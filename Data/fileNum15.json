Nobody outside of Haiti seems to want to dignify these revolutionaries with that sort of terminology, so it is still being called \"gang violence\".\n\nAs far as I can tell, the hell in Haiti isn't the result of these gangs but rather it is the cause. Even before these recent attacks in Port au Prince, a huge chunk of the population was literally starving even as food vendors were unable to maintain a living by selling food. They couldn't afford to sell food at a price people could afford to buy. \"Mud Cookies\" have been used regularly in modern decades to reduce the pain of starvation by many in the population, to the point where mud cookie vendors exist & can turn a tiny profit.\n\nThe situation in Haiti is complex. The government there failed long before the gangs got a foothold, and that made violent revolution inevitable. When people are watching children literally starve in the middle of a city while food vendors go broke just trying to sell food, while other vendors continue to survive by selling something that eases the pain of starvation while doing nothing to actually nourish the body... What do you expect? This is what happens when a society fails to meet the basic biological needs of the people.\n\nThere's an unfortunate truth in the idea that \"There are only 9 meals between mankind and anarchy.\" What's unfolding in Haiti has been brewing for decades, and still doesn't seem to have gained enough traction to make changes that matter.\n\nThis isn't just \"gang violence\".

I want to give everyone some insight on what the root of the problem is, and first you have to understand how healthcare systems make money. I\u2019ll be explaining from the US perspective, but it mostly applies to the UK as well.\n\nThe vast majority of hospitals and clinics are non-profit, and over 90% of their income comes from 3 places: Government insurance (Medicare/Medicaid in the US, NHS in the UK), Private insurance, and about 5-10% of this comes from private pay.\n\nBecause hospitals get nearly all of their funding from insurance, this means that what primarily drives their income is their doctors prescribing testing, treatments, and procedures. *And that\u2019s pretty much it*. EVERYTHING else is an extra expense that\u2019s added on to ensure that patients are brought in to see the doctors, and that the treatment and procedures that are *actually* bringing money in go *just smoothly enough* that the patients will 1) Not sue, 2) Come back next time, and 3) Recommend them to others. \n\nNow you may be thinking, \u201cOf course that\u2019s how hospitals make money, that\u2019s the service they provide. It\u2019s the same with any other business,\u201d and you would be right! But the problem is that insurance companies (including the government) and hospitals have to come to an *agreement* about how much the insurance company is willing to pay for every individual service that is provided. Combine that with the fact that healthcare systems are at their demand capacity 100% of the time, and now we have a system where the healthcare company has a ceiling for how much money they can possibly make. \n\nSo how do hospitals make more money?\n\n1) Increase demand capacity by opening more clinics and hiring more staff so you can see more patients, because more patients = more pay out for insurance.\n\n\n2) Charge the insurance companies AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE for the care that is given to each individual patient. This means both inflating your costs for care, as well as prescribing the most expensive tests, treatments, and procedures that you can get away with. (Side note: some of you may be thinking that this means doctors are prescribing things that patients don\u2019t actually need in order to make money, but it\u2019s almost always the opposite. We are constantly fighting with insurance companies to cover care that patients DO need because insurance companies don\u2019t want to pay).\n\n\n3) Cut costs on every other expense that is not bringing patients in, or is not a doctor prescribing a test, treatment, or procedure. \n\nThis last category is where nurses fall into. In the eyes of healthcare systems, we are ONLY an expense that is necessary in order to ensure that the treatment and procedures that are *actually* bringing money in go *just smoothly enough* that the patients will 1) Not sue, 2) Come back next time, and 3) Recommend them to others. That\u2019s it. And as long as the amount of income they\u2019re getting doesn\u2019t decline by a significant margin, they have absolutely no reason to pay us anymore than they already do. There\u2019s a reason that doctors and administrators get paid far more than patient care staff gets paid, and that\u2019s because they\u2019re the ones that *bring patients in and get their insurance company to spend money*. But the staff that actually *cares* for the patients is just a necessary business expense that must be minimized at all costs.\n\nSo what do we do? We stop making sure that everything goes so smoothly. And this starts with striking. But what is important for people to realize is that nurses being underpaid is a symptom of a *systemic* problem with the way healthcare systems and insurance operates financially. As far as hospitals and other healthcare companies are concerned, it *actually isn\u2019t* as easy as \u201cjust pay your nurses more.\u201d Because the truth is that hospitals and healthcare companies that rely primarily on income from insurance companies are almost always breaking even or operating at a loss. Should they pay administration less so that nurses can make more? Ethically, yes! But practically? No. Because those administrators would never accept a pay cut and would leave, which would ultimately result in less income for the hospital. \n\nSo unless there is *massive* systemic change, any pay increase that\u2019s given to nurses and other patient care staff is just a band-aid solution that will open right back up within a few years as cost of living goes up and people leave the industry. What actually needs to happen is that insurance as an industry has to be abolished, and governments have to increase their healthcare budgets *significantly*. But what that would require is the people and governments would have to stop seeing healthcare spending as a money loss and instead start to see it as an *investment* into the well-being of their people. After all, a healthy population is far more productive and profitable than a sick and under-treated population. \n\nTo summarize the problem in a word, it\u2019s *shortsightedness*.", "score": 17, "author": "Chasers_17"}, {"id": "jiaokea", "body": "I\u2019m concerned for patients too.

(This was like 2015, but target is a big store)\n\nThere were parents at my workplace that were really surprised that I wasn't taking it as serious as I should and thought it was because I didn't have kids. I was like, no statistically strangers don't want to kidnap your kids. Like... It has happened but there's no proof of this. \n\nSo the local police got involved and looked into it. Because SURPRISE, they were not yet. They checked the cameras and did see a man and woman fitting that description near the woman and her kid and the man touch the girl. It was pretty clear why she that had spoken to the couple which verified why. \n\nThe man was legally blind and bumped into her. He reached out to steady her/apologize. There was a short interaction. And that was it. \n\nNo one, including the mom, would have thought it was anything but that. \n\nAn old blind man bumped into her daughter and apologized. She decided to pretend like it was a kidnapping attempt. But not with the police because that would be illegal, but just on Facebook. And prior believed it.

So either the implication here is that the coworkers and roommates are all in on it and decided to murder him, or he had started behaving strangely and making people around him uncomfortable. \n\nThis guy was allegedly chased on foot by three truckloads of white guys hurling racial slurs for over two days in broad daylight through a populated area, and there's no camera footage or eyewitnesses whatsoever that saw these trucks? And during that time he was able to walk to and from the police station three separate times and make a call from the gas station? And then he was caught on a trail cam walking shirtless alone through the woods with no one else in sight. \n\nThe autopsy was not able to determine a cause of death but stated that there was evidence of animal activity. People are focusing on the decapitation and scattered body parts which is understandable, but not unusual when a body is left in the woods for a month and scavenged by animals. If you've ever been walking in the woods and find a random animal skull/bone, it's because another animal carried it and dropped it there. The independent autopsy done by the family didn't find anything that wasn't already known after the original autopsy, so the accusations of the state autopsy covering up information don't really make sense. \n\nThere are plenty of examples of people experiencing psychosis and going missing under \"suspicious\" circumstances, usually after telling family and friends that they are in danger or being chased by people. Brandon Lawson is one example I can think of off the top of my head. \n\nOf course, I'm not an expert in anything involving criminal investigations and this is just my opinion based on the available information, please don't take what I say as fact.

And for the really shitty guests, the message never really seemed to be \"you're trash because you're poor or you're a hillbilly\" but \"you're trash because you're a racist/sexist/phobic piece of shit who just happens to have those class markers.\" And he seemed to celebrate radical weirdness in a truly CAMP way.

Martin Luther King Jr. had just been assassinated, Bobby Kennedy was about to be, and within a few months and a few miles from here, Chicago would explode around the dysfunction of the Democratic National Convention. I remember thinking that our sheltered existence at law school, however prestigious, seemed totally detached from the chaos that consumed the world outside.*\n\n*There were 190 of us in my graduating class, and believe it or not, only two of the 190 were women. Of the 188 men, only one was African American. As a class we were too white, too male and too privileged. And though it certainly took too long to change, what comfort it is today to look out at all of you and see the racial, gender and ethnic diversity that really is America.*\n\n*But as happy as I am to look out and see all of your faces, I understand there are a number of you who aren't too happy to see mine.*\n\n*To the students who invited me \u2014 thank you. I am honored. To the students who object to my presence \u2014 well, you've got a point. I, too, would've chosen someone else. But once asked it would've been kind of arrogant, or at least unappreciative, for me to have said \"no.\" So, here I am.*\n\n*I've been lucky enough to enjoy a comfortable measure of success in my various careers, but let's be honest, I've been virtually everything you can't respect: a lawyer, a mayor, a major market news anchor and a talk show host. Pray for me. If I get to heaven, we're all going.*\n\n*Let's assume that your prime discomfort with me is based on the ethics of what I do for a living. Well, that's a fair question, worthy of a serious response. I can tell you with some confidence that you, too, will likely deal with these very same ethical considerations, no matter what path your career takes.*\n\n*Surely, in every one of my chosen professions there were ethical \"red flags\" rising virtually every day. When I was Cincinnati's mayor, there were two or three issues I really wanted to focus on. But how much would I compromise on other legislation just to get the votes I needed on my priorities? And how much pandering would I do to the voters, rationalizing that if I didn't get re-elected I wouldn't be able to get anything done?*\n\n*Then for 10 years I became a journalist \u2014 perhaps the most ethically challenging profession of all. You see, I knew that 90 percent of what's in the paper or on the television news, we don't really need to know. And yet, how often do we go with a story anyway because it will make a great headline, sell papers or drive up ratings, even if we know it might embarrass or hurt the business or career or family or reputation of the person we're reporting on? That is a daily ethical question that I can tell you is almost always ignored.*\n\n*And then, of course, there is my profession now as host of a crazy talk show. Well, at least I can rationalize that the show is only open to those who really want to be on it, and they get to choose the subject matter, what is revealed and what must not be revealed. Even with this I grapple with ethical questions.*\n\n*What about the career most of you will be choosing, that of an attorney? Think of the ethical issues you will have to deal with. Will you work for a corporate client who perhaps is polluting? Will you walk into your senior partner's office after having been asked to prepare a memorandum in support of this client's case and say, \"I'm sorry, I'll have to leave and find another place to work,\" and then explain to your family why there won't be a paycheck coming in this month?*\n\n*I'm not suggesting that these moral dilemmas don't have answers. But what I am saying is that whatever you plan to do with this diploma, the ethical questions will never stop.*\n\n*Welcome to life. Unavoidably, you will all join me on this witness stand of conscience, trying your best to figure it out \u2014 never perfectly but, hopefully, always sincerely.*\n\n*It is perhaps inevitable that we are inclined to always judge others. But let me share this observation. I am not superior to the people on my show, and you are not superior to the people you will represent. That is not an insult. It is merely an understanding derived from a life spent on the front lines of human interaction. We are all alike. Some of us just dress better or have more money, or perhaps we were born into better circumstances of parental upbringing, health, brains and luck.*\n\n*On this great day when we honor your achievement, we might also say thank you to God in full recognition that whatever we achieve in life is 99 percent a gift.*\n\n*Life is a gift \u2014 as is living in America. And I know that from personal experience. You see, I am not the first lawyer in my family. My dad's brother was. His practice was cut short, as was his life \u2014 in Auschwitz. My grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins \u2014 they met their end as well in Chelmno, Theresienstadt and in camp after camp, Hitler turning my family tree into a single vine. Mom and Dad, by the grace of God, survived, enabling them to bring my sister and me ultimately to America.*\n\n*With four tickets on the Queen Mary, January 1949, we sailed into New York Harbor. In silence, all the ship's passengers gathered on the top deck of this grand ocean liner as we passed by the Statue of Liberty. My mom told me in later years (I was 5 at the time) that while we were shivering in the cold, I had asked her \"What are we looking at? What does the statue mean?\" In German she replied, \"Ein Tag, alles!\" (One day, everything!)*\n\n*She was right. In one generation here in America, my family went from near total annihilation to this ridiculously privileged life I live today because of my silly show. Indeed, in America, all things are possible.*\n\n*So as we honor your achievement, may it be for you as it was for me, \"Ein Tag, alles!\" One day, everything!*\n\n*Thank you for having me.*", "score": 5, "author": "Y-Cha", "page_title": "Jerry Springer's 2008 Northwestern Law Commencement Speech"}, {"id": "jhxazs4", "body": "[It's been one week since it was a week before Jerry Springer's death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbfiEfVfo4M)", "score": 3, "author": "Schiffy94", "page_title": "Jerry Springer (Parody of \"One Week\" by BareNaked Ladies) - YouTube"}]},

Sources suggest that the FBI and IRS finished their investigation into Hunter Biden over a year ago, and there is growing frustration inside the FBI due to the delay.\n\nThe decision on whether to file charges will be made by U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump and retained by the Biden administration to continue the investigation. The federal investigation of Hunter Biden began in 2018 as an inquiry into his international business relationships but has since narrowed down to an examination of the income he earned from those ventures and a false statement he allegedly made during the gun purchase.

It's actually quite a bit of work. You need to see opportunity when it strikes and then exploit it. For example, if you happen across a post on Reddit where a man talks about going through a messy divorce, losing custody of his kids and most of his wealth, and being depressed that his wife is living with a new man. \n\nBingo. \n\nEstablish communication that can't be traced back to you. Do not incriminate yourself in any that can be recorded or traced. Just a precaution, assuming everything goes well you've got no worries. Pricing largely depends on the client's budget and motivation. This man has lost everything, so what will he give to get back something? Maybe 10k? Or even 50k? Figure out their job and salary, get an idea for how much savings they might have by reviewing their current financial situation. How many vehicles and of what quality do they own? Is the home fully paid for? How long have they worked their current job and what's the salary like? You can likely get a middle-class man to pay nearly 40k for a job like this. \n\nFrom there set the contract. Ex-wife and her new husband meet an untimely end while your client is conveniently in sight of many witnesses. The less the client knows about you and the job the better, they won't accidentally incriminate themselves if they don't know how the hit happens. Can't have them slipping up and giving information the detectives or police haven't publicly released yet. You'll lose out on a lot of business if you try to get them to pay first. Do the job, then get the money. If they don't pay just anonymously submit evidence of their participation without giving yourself up. They'll catch the heat for hiring a contract killer. Sure it's a huge waste of time on your end since you didn't get paid. But that's how it goes. Most clients are smart enough to realize what they owe and what they have to lose. \n\nThat's how I'd do it. For actually carrying out the job an important statistics to consider is that most murder cases remain unsolved. Unless a culprit is captured after committing the crime or incriminated by video/DNA evidence it's highly unlikely they'll ever be caught. It's nearly impossible to solve a murder case in which the killer is unrelated to the victim. Without clear motive and thing else to go on. \n\nIf you walk down the street, go up to a door, kick it down, walk in and murder the residents, then return home, assuming no one saw you do it, you'd get away with it.

That is just called Monday in America. This would be the 146th mass shooting in 100 days. That is one every 16.4 hours.\n\nEdit: Since this kind of blew up, my math given was using the gun violence archive information as of this morning when I looked, and their definition of mass shooting as: one incident that has four or more victims alive or dead and not including the shooter.\n\nEdit 2: I personally don't think we should be redefining the definition of a mass shooting outside of this scope. The definition outlined in my first edit is pretty cut and dry. Although, I do agree we can split it into sub categories of different types of mass shootings I think we need a least a baseline that a mass shooting is a mass shooting. Also, I agree socioeconomics, healthcare, and a lot of other legislative hurdles lead to these events, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't also try to regulate firearms. Whatever happened to us trying to do all the things not because they are easy but because they are hard? We should really try and get back to that.\n\nEdit 3: What annoys me about the conversation about the definition of \"mass shooting\" and the various different taxonomies of what different mass shootings look like are that people always want to paint a particular narrative. The conversation always ultimately comes down to, \"Well by that definition a majority of these are just gang violence, so whatever right?\"\n\nOkay, so here is a thought experiment. Two guys in a gang start shooting at each other at a local park where some little kids are playing and some equally innocent teens are in the middle of a heated game of basketball. Ten people get hit by the ensuing gunfire and three of them die. That should still be considered a mass shooting whether it was intentional or not. I'm sure the family members and victims would want to be noticed, given help, or mourned just as much as anyone else subjected to needless violence. Now is that instance different than say this shooting, or the Aurora Colorado shooting, or Virginia Tech, or Las Vegas? Certainly, but all I am talking about here is a taxonomic baseline.\n\nRegardless of what kind of mass shooting it is, we should be having nuanced conversations about correcting the problems that lead to them. I'm just saying that in order to get there we need to at least have an easy to measure threshold. The types of violent gun related crime and the topics of conversation about them are just as important as the next. The factors that go into gang violence shouldn't just be swept to the side and neither should the mental health problems that go into creating some of these monsters that shoot up schools or annihilate their families. ALL OF IT IS IMPORTANT! We should all be free to live in a world where this doesn't happen nearly as often or at all. So quit making it about one thing or another.

Andy Beshear, the governor, had friends killed today and is vocally left-leaning despite it being a red state - he has had to do too many press conferences after too many tragedies during his term, and meanwhile our state representatives are focused on bizarre and useless fake-outrage topics like don't say gay bills.\n\nAll local rumors I have heard and as were shown on the police scanners were that a suicidal man in his mid-20s, who may have been a current or former employee, told his friend he was going to kill himself and people at the bank. The local news is currently (as I type this) reporting it was a local man who may have been a FORMER employee and he may have been killed by police, or self-inflicted. \n\nIf guns weren't so available, a suicidal person would kill themselves and only themselves. Guns allow them to take their suicidal ideation on others.\n\nEdit - I'd also like to add the the mayor of the city has only been in office a short time, but has tried to implement gun control measures so far (see: https://www.whas11.com/article/news/kentucky/mayor-craig-greenberg-lmpd-interim-chief-illegal-gun-crisis-louisville-kentucky/417-e4811ae7-29c3-4596-8569-86967191fe83) and Kentucky may have a lot of problems, and I don't thnink our state legislature will do anythign about this.

Trungpa's alcohol use was so extreme that some characterized him as an alcoholic, and he often combined drinking with teaching. He had a severe car accident in 1969, which some accounts ascribe to drinking. Trungpa's cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community, and he spent $40,000 a year on it, according to the memoir of his students, John Steinbeck IV and his wife. An infamous incident involved the poet W. S. Merwin and his girlfriend at a Halloween party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary in 1975, where Trungpa's Vajra Guard forced entry into their locked and barricaded room, stripped them of all their clothes, and ignored Naone's pleas for help and for someone to call the police. The incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published \"The Great Naropa Poetry Wars.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd his successor, \u00d6sel Tendzin, who was the Regent and heir to the Tibetan Buddhist master Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa, engaged in sexual relationships with students and was known to be promiscuous, including seducing straight men. One student reported that Tendzin had raped him. It was also revealed in 1989 that Tendzin had contracted HIV and continued to have unprotected sex with his students without informing them, transmitting it to a student who later died of AIDS. Others close to Tendzin knew about his condition but kept silent. Tendzin claimed that Trungpa had told him that as long as he did his Vajrayana purification practices, he could not transmit the disease. According to Trungpa's wife and widow, he became disillusioned with Tendzin as his heir and called him \"terrible\" and \"dreadful\" during his final illness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSogyal Rinpoche, a Tibetan Buddhist master, faced accusations of sexual abuse and misconduct from his female students in a $10 million civil lawsuit filed in 1994. The lawsuit was settled out of court. Further allegations emerged in 2011 and 2014, including Marion Dapsance's seven-year investigation, which reported on the sexual and psychological abuse suffered by one of Rinpoche's long-term female attendants. In 2017, senior Rigpa students wrote a twelve-page letter detailing sexual, physical, and emotional abuse by Rinpoche of Rigpa students, and his lavish and indulgent lifestyle supported by donations. Matthieu Ricard, a close adviser to the Dalai Lama, stated that Rinpoche's behavior was \"obviously unacceptable.\"\n\nJune Campbell, a former Kagyu nun who is a feminist scholar, acted as Kalu Rinpoche's translator for several years. In her book Traveller in Space: Gender, Identity and Tibetan Buddhism,\\[3\\] she writes that she consented to participate in what she realised later was an abusive sexual relationship with him, which he told her was tantric spiritual practice. She raises the same theme in a number of interviews, including one with Tricycle magazine in 1996.\\[4\\] Since the book was published she has received \"letters from women all over the world with similar and worse experiences\" with other gurus.\\[5\\]\n\nAlso, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/oct/08/tibetan-lamas-buddhism](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/oct/08/tibetan-lamas-buddhism), The article discusses the issue of sexual misconduct by Tibetan Buddhist lamas, including recent allegations against Lama Tempa Dargye, a senior monk at Kagyu Ling in France. He has been imprisoned following allegations of rape and sexual violence by four women, including one who claims to have been raped at the age of nine. French police have also launched an investigation into financial irregularities at the center.  \nThe article notes that scandals involving sexual misconduct by lamas have been reported around the world. For example, in the US, Trungpa Rinpoche's appointed successor, Thomas Rich, was accused of infecting several people with HIV, and Sogyal Rinpoche was sued for sexual assault in California in 1994. In Australia, Lama Choedak was forced to make a public apology after multiple affairs with his female students came to light, and in the UK, Michael Lyons, who posed as a Tibetan lama, is serving 10 years in prison after being convicted of rape.", "score": 125, "author": "nbcs", "page_title": "Page Not Found | The Guardian"}, {"id": "jfpk76q", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 29, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jfoo4us", "body": "Mother Teressa \u2714  \nDalai Lama \u2714\n\nWho's up next?", "score": 452, "author": "SanguShellz"}, {"id": "jfojvh5", "body": "Aaah fuck bro, you were supposed to be one of the good ones.", "score": 526, "author": "me1112"}, {"id": "jfpas32", "body": "> \u201cHis Holiness often teases people he meets in an innocent and playful way\"\n\nWhat???????????????

Fox News has been the beneficiary of government largess for years and it is time stop it and make Fox pay its own way. As far back as 1999, there have been reports documenting how News Corp, Fox's parent company, exploited loopholes in tax laws that permitted them to avoid levies that all other citizens have to pay. From The Economist:\n\n>> \"...News Corporation and its subsidiaries paid only A$325m ($238m) in corporate taxes worldwide. In the same period, its consolidated pre-tax profits were A$5.4 billion. So News Corporation has paid an effective tax rate of only around 6%. By comparison, Disney, one of the world's other media empires, paid 31%. Basic corporate-tax rates in Australia, America and Britain, the three main countries in which News Corporation operates, are 36%, 35% and 30% respectively.\"\n\n>The article goes on to describe how News Corp used a complex network of accounting dodges including as many as 60 shell companies that were incorporated in such tax havens as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, the Netherlands Antilles and the British Virgin Islands. More recently, an investigation by the New York Times revealed that...\n\n>>    \"By taking advantage of a provision in the law that allows expanding companies like Mr. Murdoch's to defer taxes to future years, the News Corporation paid no federal taxes in two of the last four years, and in the other two it paid only a fraction of what it otherwise would have owed. During that time, Securities and Exchange Commission records show, the News Corporation's domestic pretax profits topped $9.4 billion.\"\n\n>When giant, prosperous, multinational corporations weasel out of their tax obligations, ordinary citizens are the ones who are forced to make up the shortfall. That is effectively a tax subsidy for the corporations funded by you and me and all of the indignant Tea Partiers who claim to oppose special interest favors for the elite.\n\n>What's more, federal bailouts to corporations like General Motors and Citigroup provided them with billions of taxpayer dollars, some of which are eventually spent on advertising that appears on Fox News, in the Wall Street Journal, and other Murdoch assets. Additionally, financial institutions that receive bailout funds use some that money to acquire shares of News Corp and to finance and insure News Corp activities including billion dollar motion picture projects like Avatar and capitalizing mergers and expansions.\n\n>Where are the voices objecting to these handouts? Why is there no campaign to force corporations to pay their fair share? Democrats in Congress should immediately draft legislation prohibiting bailout and stimulus funds from being used to enrich partisan political operations like Fox News by funneling cash into their accounts disguised as advertising expenditures. Every time you see a commercial on the Fox News Channel for a Chevy Tahoe or a Citibank Visa you are watching your tax dollars flow into the pockets of Rupert Murdoch and his wealthy associates.\n\n>The right wants to defund NPR despite the fact that they have utterly failed to demonstrate any journalistic bias on the part of NPR. On the other hand, Fox News has been documented to be brazenly one-sided over and over again, yet they receive hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer financed subsidies.

YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY DETERMINES WHAT HAPPENS. YOU CAN STAY IN THE HOSPITAL, BUT YOUR INSURANCE WON'T PAY.   \nI am not absolving the hospital, since I have no idea what actually happened. But the primary reason that more people aren't observed overnight in the hospital or discharged too early is that insurance companies are extremely serious about their criteria for what constitutes medical necessity for hospitalization. WTF do you think is going to happen when hospital admin learn the patterns that prevent them from being paid by your insurance-- your ass is getting thrown out as soon as it is possible that insurance isn't going to pay.   \nI hate our healthcare system so much.   \nI hate that our country can't have an adult conversation about it.   \nI hate that nearly everybody that has actually had to use their insurance hates private insurance companies and nearly everyone that has had a life-threatening or serious chronic illness hates and fears our healthcare system. Yet we have millions of blissfully unaware people who are totally unaware of how little financial or health security they \\*actually\\* have.   \n\n\nMark my words. When you get sick, if your illness is not mind-bendingly obvious it will take an absolute minimum of 3 doctors visits to have a diagnosis. First, either a doc in the box or primary care doctor, who will refer you to a specialist--> two months pass--> you see the specialist, who assures you it is not in their specialty, follow up with PCP--> you see PCP again, let's try another specialist--> Sorry Mario, your princess is in another castle. You see what I mean. It will take months and months of waiting and worrying before you might just have some answers. During that time, work and home life will be much more difficult, and while your family may show sympathy, you job almost certainly won't, especially if you are on lower end of the income scale. So now not only do you feel a bit worried and a bit helpless to get yourself better, you are anxious that you could potentially lose your job or screw up your career track. Your sleep worsens and you eat more poorly, compounding your problem. You feel alone and desperate, even willing to see quacks and read internet medical pages filled with misinformation (and it can be extremely difficult to tell the difference between misinformation and actually medical knowledge unless you have extensive medical training).   \n\n\nDid doctors just get stupider? Perhaps. Or perhaps it's because your insurance pays for about 10 minutes of time with your employed physician, and requires 20 minutes of paperwork in addition to the 10 minutes of time spent working with you. Most of the actual work (time spent working) as a physician is done doing bureaucratic tasks rather than interacting with you, the reason the job exists in the first place. On top of that intense time pressure, about 30-50% of people have no concern for being on time. So while you showed up on time, 3 people earlier in the day showed up kind of late, but not late enough to keep them from being rescheduled. And one of those late people was late because they are 85 years old and their ride was late, and when they got there you had to spend 30 minutes with them to make sure that their acute symptoms did not require them to go to the ER.   \nAnd on top of that time pressure, the employed doctor has zero control over staffing, so regardless of how well or how poor the workflow is, they have to make it work the best they can. Hospitals are scraping the absolute bottom of the barrel for staffing. Things that were previously done by professional nurses are now done by people with no actual professional training and often a work ethic that is incompatible with healthcare. Which causes rapid turnover (now even worse since COVID) in staff, which means the unprofessional staff is also mostly made of of inexperienced people. And that means a lot more mistakes and delays.   \nIf a doctor does not keep up the pace, they will not be in medicine any longer (and that isn't an option considering the amount of dept they have to get their career).   \nMy point is this-- The US healthcare system makes it exceptionally difficult for physicians to practice the way they want and the way you want. This lack of time means that their understanding of your unique history will be impaired. You will not benefit nearly as much from their insights (and may therefore miss out on opportunities to change behaviors that can alter the course of your life). And ultimately, you will spend more time and money to get answers when you are sick.   \n\n\nIn the insurance model, there is no way to escape this problem. If your employed doctor spends plenty of time with you, then congrats, but they are donating their services to you and it will not be sustainable. They will either burn out and quit medicine altogether (like many of my colleagues have done), or the will fall in line and pick up the volume and transition to much shorter appointments.   \n\n\nIf you read this far then perhaps you would be interested in some advice. Consider finding a direct primary care doctor. If you've never heard of direct primary care, read up on it. The basic premise is that the doctor charges an up-front monthly fee that is inclusive of all services, something like $60-100 a month. This allows them to have much smaller patient panels and much more time to spend with you when you need it. You still use your insurance for medications (though they will help you get generic drugs cheaply if that is an option, and often offer very low cost lab testing for cash pay prices). I appreciate that this is a lot of money for many people, but what you get in return is far more valuable.   \nBy bypassing the insurance company and paying the doctor directly, you will have a doctor that actually knows you, can spend much more time with you, and can be available much more readily than a doctor who works within the insurance model. So the day that the shit eventually goes down, you have an ally that knows you as an individual and will fight for you much more effectively against our Kafkaesque healthcare system. I firmly believe direct primary care is the only way that normal people can access a traditional patient-doctor relationship now.   \nI want to mention that I am \\*not\\* a direct primary care doctor, and have no financial interest in direct primary care. I am a specialist and fighting every day to try to make it work in the insurance world, but I see the writing on the wall after working in the system for 18 years. in my specialty, I routinely see people who do not feel heard and do not feel cared for. I have had my own relatively benign medical issues and have had terrible experiences seeking out healthcare. I could write for days about my experiences and how much they have changed my perspective on medicine. And if there was one thing that I could advise the average person to do, it would be to find a primary care doctor you trust that can spend time with you and that you trust. And I think the best way to find one of those is to exit insurance and go direct.", "score": 4, "author": "Mercurial_Honkey"}, {"id": "jfxeuom", "body": "When people try to tell you the outright lie that hospitals don\u2019t turn people away for lack of insurance or money, remember THIS\u2026..", "score": 1, "author": "BlastedSandy"}, {"id": "jfinnmi", "body": "Yet the police did cause her death.

Consider this scenario:\n\n* You are transporting a minor, for whom you are not the guardian or parent, from Idaho to another State. Perhaps you are an extended family member, teacher, family friend, church leader, doctor, care provider, or other close associate. Perhaps you are transporting your children and they bring a friend with them. All these common scenarios get you one step closer to breaking this law.\n* Then, independent of your knowledge, that minor gets a day-after pill or sneaks away and gets an abortion. Perhaps they simply buy the pill but don't actually use it. You are now another step closer to being a criminal. Remember, this could potentially apply to young boys who buy a pill, too. Maybe for their girlfriend or sister who is pregnant back in Idaho. You are accountable.\n* Finally, the guardian or parents find out. They blame you, or just don't like you. Maybe they are angry at their child but they are going to take it out on you. Whatever it is. All they have to do is file a complaint with the AGs office. It is a real possibility you will end up in handcuffs. You might not be convicted, but you are in for a world of ruin simply by being accused. How will you prove you didn't have anything to do with it? How will you prove you aren't concealing involvement?\n\nSo there you go Idahoans (and everyone else). You made your bed. You will lie in it. Then, we will all hear you attempt to justify that YOUR case is different. YOU are special. YOU should get the exception. YOU are the odd-one. But, you won't be. You'll be just like everyone else.\n\nSo, what should every person in the United States do (this impacts more than just Idahoans)?\n\n1. REFUSE to transport any minor child from Idaho to another State unless you are the proper LEGAL parent or guardian. No friends allowed. No cousins. No nephews or nieces. No grandchildren. No students. No athletes. No church groups. NO ONE. It doesn't mater if you live in Idaho or not. Don't do it. They can't visit. They can't spend the night. They can't be away from their parent/guardian at any time in your car, house, property, and so on.\n2. Maintain CONSTANT supervision of any such minor to ensure they do not visit a pharmacy or clinic, or talk to anyone who has.\n3. DISCLOSE to every guardian or parent, upon you returning their child, that you are not aware of any such time their child could have purchased a pill or gotten an abortion. Disclose any medical treatments, visits to a pharmacy, or incidental knowledge related to this.  In short, affirm that you are not concealing anything. Put it in writing. Record a video. Get some evidence.\n\nThis will make every unemancipated minor child in Idaho a potential legal risk to every adult in the US. Can you count on that kid to tell the truth if they are caught? Will anyone believe them if they do?\n\nUnclear grey area: What if a parent and child are visiting Idaho, and you take that child (as a non-parent) across state lines to get an abortion? What if you just drive through or fly over Idaho?\n\nOf course this is going to end up in the courts. Parts of it may be tossed. Rest assured... The Idaho legislature will just keep on trying.

For years I tried to be Catholic, I tried to be a \"good\" person and defend the church, to praise the Church hierarchy and the saints. To model my life after these people. I went to a Catholic grade school, a Catholic high school, and Catholic youth group. I went to confession, I read the Bible, I even considered pursuing the priesthood. I'd heard of the critiques of the Church and dismissed them, as many around me did, as being simply accusations by those unable to handle the truth of Catholicism, or simply failures of humans that didn't represent the rest of the Church.\n\nThen, I started to learn more about Catholic history. The crusades, the genocides in South America and Africa, the work with Nazis, the indulgences, and, of course, the sexual abuse. This was far from a Catholic-only issue, but to stay away from airing my grievances with religion and Christianity as a whole, as I think that's a separate conversation, let's focus on Catholicism. Many of the Saints, like Saint Patrick, are people who actively oppressed groups that opposed them, and many of the people I looked up to, Popes and priests, turned out to be sexual predators.\n\nAround the age of 15 or 16, I started to realize I was bisexual. This added a great deal of emotional and spiritual distress to my life, and, being unable to talk to my parents about it, I turned to my friends in music and theater, and they gave me the support I needed to begin to understand myself. Around 19 or 20, I began to realize I was nonbinary, and similarly relied on my friends to help me understand what this meant. The Catholic Church, meanwhile, reaffirmed time and again that homosexuality and transitioning were both undeniable sins. \n\nDuring this same time, more and more reports were issued about the sexual abuse that continued into my teenage lifespan, and the discovery of thousands of native children found dead underneath Catholic institutions. I, like many others, had already departed from being a complete Catholic, but returned home for breaks and such. What were my parents upset about? What were they angry about, in front of 2 openly queer children and 1 closeted one (myself)? The drag queens. The drag queens and the \"transgenders\" and the \"demonic\" pansexuals. \n\nCatholicism, is, at its core, as valid as any other religious belief. Anyone can follow the tenets and the beliefs as much as they want, it's your right. But there needs to be a reckoning within the Church to do something to evaluate it's history, who it puts on a pedestal, and how it addresses it's mistakes. There needs to be some sort of change - not just words, not apologies. Change. Some of these priests are still being protected. Some in this case were not on the list the Church gave of its own internal review. Even if there is good will to be found among those at the top, it is clear that a full upheaval is needed of the system, and yet it has not happened.

Perry told him before his sentencing Monday in Greene County Court that his actions have forever changed her from a happy child to one who is struggling with anguish from the sexual abuse.\n\n\n>\u201cI see a young lady who\u2019s been through the worst things you could imagine. This girl is troubled every day,\u201d a male relative said during a victim impact statement before sentencing. \u201cChildren are precious, but that little girl didn\u2019t get to feel precious. ... This can never be given back, ever.\u201d\n\n\n>Perry, 43, of Monongahela Township, was charged in June 2017 and accused of sexually assaulting the preteen girl on several occasions between the summer of 2016 and March 2017. A Greene County jury convicted Perry following a two-day trial in December on charges of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a child, indecent assault and corruption of minors.\n\n\n>The girl, who is now 16, did not attend the sentencing hearing for Perry, but two relatives spoke about how the abuse has affected her. A female relative said that before the abuse, the girl was having a normal childhood, but afterward she began getting into trouble at school and eventually ran away from home. Later, she was hospitalized for mental health issues as she \u201ccrumbled\u201d just before Perry\u2019s trial.\n\n>\u201cThis young lady is covered in scars,\u201d the woman said.\n\n>President Judge Lou Dayich sentenced Perry to serve 40 to 80 years in prison in what ultimately could be a life sentence. Dayich also ordered Perry to register as a sex offender with the state police\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law list for the rest of his life.\n\n>When Dayich asked Perry if he wished to address the court, the convicted man said he was told not to on the advice of his public defender Harry Cancelmi.\n\n>\u201cHe said no,\u201d Perry told the judge, alluding to Cancelmi\u2019s advice not to speak.\n\n>Perry is still awaiting trial onthousands of additional charges in a separate case in which he is accused of molesting a different girl. State police charged him in October 2020 with nearly 15,000 separate counts for the alleged ongoing abuse of that girl dating back to 2008.\n\n>Perry has been jailed since he was arrested in Morgantown, W.Va., in August 2017, nearly three months after state police filed charges in the original case. It took more than four years for Perry to go to trial after he was originally deemed incompetent to face the charges and was admitted for mental health treatment on three separate occasions at Torrance State Hospital near Blairsville.\n\n>He will serve his sentence at a state prison that will be determined at a later date, although he is expected to remain at the Greene County jail while awaiting the adjudication of the second case.\n\n>His wife, Cheyenna Perry, 39, pleaded guilty in December 2018 to recording videos and taking photographs of a girl engaged in sexual acts, and then sending them to her husband while he was trying to evade capture in the summer of 2017. She was sentenced to serve 3\u00bd to 7 years in state prison and ordered to register for life as a sex offender after she pleaded guilty to all charges in exchange for her cooperation in her husband\u2019s case.

I live less than a quarter of a mile from where they're trying to build the training facility.\n\nI've been in Atlanta for years and years and I've enjoyed these woods and ponds for over a decade.\n\nThe morning of Feb. 6 (my birthday) I woke up and felt awesome, also a little hungover but it was a beatiful day. I picked up my tactical pack and put a small tackle bag and my Springfield Hellcat in said bag. I wore a bright red flannel as I'm going out alone.\n\nTo preface this: I am not on Facebook or Instagram. I generally just treat people kindly and mind my own business. I don't ever want to hurt anyone. I didn't know the parameters of this \"development.\"\n\nUntil now.\n\nI was about to string up a pretty awesome roostertail I've always had good luck with over there. Great fishing out by Prison Farm! Then I saw a barrage of Georgia State Patrol officers coming down the trail with a K9 unit. Super cute Shephard.\n\nI set down my rod and stood up to let my presence be known. I just didn't want to cause any dissention. I wanted to mind my own goddamn business as I usually do. I'm glad I didn't have my dumbass pittie out there with me.\n\nOne officer advances with a kinda cheap 223/556 very quickly and exclaims \"GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND!\"\n\nI obviously obliged. I have a whole slew of living beings I care about and that care about me; I don't want to get killed.\n\nKnee to the neck.\nNo body cams.\n\nI promptly let them know that I am armed. (I'm in the woods alone.) They took my pistol. Springfield Hellcat compact 9mm. They didn't ask about the Kershaw on my right pocket but I told them about it too.\n\nAn hour later they let me go. They did give me my pistol back. Told me not to insert my mag until I got home. Obviously I obliged.\n\nOne of the worst things I did hear was one of the officers saying \"I can't wait until they bulldoze all of this shit.\" I'm not even one of the protesters. I live there. That's my home. I have my partner, my two dogs, my two cats, and equity on a home my millennial ass has taken so many strides to buy.\n\nThis shit sucks. They murdered a dude with his hands up. Heard about this several days ago. I just want to live at peace in my neighborhood. None of us wanted this. I haven't been as vocal as I should but I cannot refrain from speaking out.\n\nI was so scared my lady would see me with a bullet hole in my head. I'm not usually afraid of much.\n\nThat was the second scariest moment of my life.\n\n(The first is when I found my dad after he drowned.)\n\nPeople need to know these police are unhinged.\n\nEdit: this is the first time I've typed this all out and I really hope it helps to bring light to what's happening over there. I don't want people throwing stuff at cops like the Sunday protest. I just want everyone to be okay. And I'm not. I'm not okay at all.\n\nEdit 2: I was listening to Among The Wildflowers by The Wailin' Jennys and if you haven't heard that song you should check it out. I'm gonna go rewrite this without expletives to have saved. Be careful out there. Cops don't care about you it seems. Just wanted to be free. Weird serendipity but I'm an emotional man.\n\nEdit 3: I'm going to type out everything in a less emotional state and it will be something to help our activists out there. They will recieve the document. I will adamantly say that I don't want anyone to hurt someone. (Apparently that's the job of police in America.) I'm just a little redneck kid from middle Georgia.

Companies of course who likely understand their role in keeping their role in check. \n\nJohn smith can\u2019t afford to go on a vacation let alone a road trip to bring his kiddos to see grandma anymore because John smith can\u2019t take a day off work, can\u2019t waste precious gas and the kids always want to buy snacks from the gas station on the way there so John decided they\u2019ll just call Grammy up on video chat when he gets off work at 8 pm. Now this is all good and well that Grammy gets to see and hear her loved ones, but the point is forgotten that John Smith can\u2019t afford a day trip to go see his own mother, not until payday and then he\u2019ll have to decide between going and seeing her or buying his son a game that just went on sale online to distract his son from the fact that his dad can\u2019t afford to put him in an after school sport where he would undoubtedly have more fun and it would be far more stimulating for him. \n\nOf course that last bit is gonna piss some gamers off. Let it be known I too am a gamer, but I also played sports growing up until my family became so broke when I was in HS where it was no longer feasible, but I joined the cheapest sport there was, wrestling. Of course video games are great, they teach a lot of different skills, but no more and none greater than what is taught in person to person games, on a team of people you have learned to know and respect over a period of time. \n\n These are just two small examples of the things in life we let slip away because hey, might not be able to afford a trip driving through our country, but we can watch some goofy movie/some semi wealthy influencer do it instead, and if we squint our eyes we can almost imagine ourselves there. \n\n We\u2019ve been told our whole lives this is your life you choose how to live it, then that power was slowly taken from us and we were given increasingly shittily produced movies to keep us happy, and many many movies I\u2019ve seen have repeatedly taken digs at society, incredibles 2 was rife with it and I couldn\u2019t stop myself from looking about the room. This was legitimately like hearing someone, A talk mad shit about person B, mentioning how pathetic they are and as person C you\u2019re blown away because person B is standing right there, but person A used just the right words so person B feels like it wasn\u2019t about them, and you as person C are getting really sick of all of these digs at society just being thrown up as a big joke that we\u2019re all in on. Except we\u2019re the butt of the joke and we laugh along. That\u2019s how good the entertainment industry has gotten, they can make digs at the state of our lives, put a line somewhere in the monologue that says something to the affect of \u201cbut you aren\u2019t gonna do anything are you, what can you do?\u201d And we all say ha what a great movie, I love so and so actor, oh and the cgi was so realistic it was almost like I was in their world!\n\n\n  This is of course a fucking novel and I highly doubt the vast majority will make it this far, but to wrap it all up, maybe it\u2019s time we stop pretending we care about being entertained? Maybe it\u2019s time we stop looking for distractions and we feel the true burn of how little of REAL life we truly can enjoy, we let that pain hurt, and we take that pain and guide it to the realization that we could have stood up at any point, if we truly understood just how destitute we\u2019d become when we aren\u2019t ALWAYS distracted. Just a hypothesis though, I\u2019ve been wrong before.\n\n\n\nEdit: I mean what the hell, with how easy things should be nowadays compared to how fucking grueling life was way back whenever, I would imagine the last thing the US economy would ever want is people actively feeling their lack of power and instead of being distracted, meeting up and starting their own organizations with real representation of the people standing up and saying now wait a minute we\u2019ve been feeling out just how broken this shit is, and we\u2019re backed by the people.

Turns out, the landlord had our units in our name, and so Arlington County had me listed as the resident. My god, the calls and paperwork that went back and forth.\n\nMy landlord didn't actually live in Virginia, he lived in New Jersey, and wasn't exactly easy to contact. I ended up having to hire a lawyer to sort it all out, and no surprises here: paperwork was filled out all wrong on both sides, and one set from one county office conflicted with sets at other county offices. The judge in my case first said that I owed it, but my lawyer had to explain that I didn't own the property, my name was not on the title, and I hadn't lived there for 5 years (I had only lived there for less than 2 years).  It was listed as a  \"transferable fee,\" but only to the person who currently owned and inherited the property of which I was neither: I was a tenant, and my lease stated utilities were included BUT would be paid by the owner, my landlord (there was some ambiguity, but my lawyer got some utility bills somehow that showed they were being paid by the landlord in exchange for a flat rate).  The landlord was covered by an LLC, which had multiple names, and for obvious reasons, none of those names wanted to pay it.  The prosecution for the county was adamant that I pay it and then get reimbursed by the landlord, but I did not have $46,000, and didn't want to pay that even if I did.  On top of that, she started pissing off the judge because of the conflicting paperwork: one set listed me as a store with an address a mile down the road, while another had me as the owner of a house where it had been proven the deed belonged to my landlord's LLC, and a second set of paperwork with my address with the name of the previous owner (who also rented the property) but was now deceased, and had been for 4 years. And prosecution kept accidentally referring to me by this deceased person's name throughout the hearings.\n\nMy landlord never showed up to any of these hearings, so oddly enough, the case was dropped, or at least the case with me owing it.
