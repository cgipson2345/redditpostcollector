    {"subreddit": "lifehacks", "body": "Our physical surroundings affect our mood/psychological state (proven in many researches). But what I really meant to convey here is that whenever you think your thoughts are going out of your control, change your place. Maybe you're in your bed, in a specific location of your room/apartment, in a specific chair that is placed a certain way. Just get out of that place and sit/stand somewhere else. \nWe form a lot of mental habits and associate our emotions to multiple physical stimulations. How we are sitting/standing/lying down in a certain space can also contribute to that stimulation. I remember texting this person I don't speak to anymore a lot from my bed. And I've gotten really sad over it even when I try not to. The same was happening to me one evening when I felt severely trapped in negative thoughts and felt overwhelmed by how much I was missing her. That's when it hit me and I quickly decided to move to my work chair. I know, there are many variables here\u2014 maybe it was the act of getting up, or moving or sitting down, I don't know for sure but it helped me. So the next thing you think your thoughts are uncontrollably racing towards a certain darkness, try observing if it happens in a specific place and then move away from it. Maybe create new associations with that place but move away from it for that time. \nI hope this helps you, even if a little. Be awesome to each other!\n\nEdit 1\u2014\nTLDR; If you feel too depressed in your bed, just place a chair next to it and sit in that chair, that'll help you control your negative thoughts. Or move to a different part of the house/apartment. You have to break the patterns that trigger and entrap you into those negative thoughts.\n\nEdit 2\u2014\nThis advice is for people who feel generally down or depressed. I am NOT a psychiatrist. Please don't use these words on someone who suffers from clinical, or server depression. In any case, we have no right to tell a person suffering from depression to \"just get off your lazy ass\" or do this or that. If you have a friend or a loved one who suffers from depression, please try to be more empathic towards them and treat them with more respect. Sometimes, people just need other people to be there for them, not give advice based NOT in science or unrelated to them.", "title": "Feeling depressed or unable to move your thoughts to a brighter place?

My wife insists on staying at hotels when we travel. If I am alone, I prefer to camp. I like to stay in KOA's or similar places. State parks are good too, I like to start and end my day with indoor plumbing. I have a pop-up tent and an air mattress. I can set up and takedown camp in 15 minutes. I roll in late and leave early. I use a jet boil to make coffee and usually hit McDonalds for breakfast. I eat dinner at a restaurant before I get to camp.\n\nFor road food I take a small cooler. I take peanut butter and jelly, along with a loaf of bread and some fruit. I love eating a simple lunch in some out of the way place. I make sure to keep some top ramen, a couple of cans of chili and some oatmeal for those times when I find myself camping in the middle of nowhere. All cookable on my backpacking stove.\n\nMy number one hack is don't live and die by the itinerary. If a stop presents itself, stop. Some of my most memorable visits have been ones where I saw a sign and decided to check it out. \n\nTo relieve the pressure, I don't usually book my campsite till later the same day. Yes, there have been a few times when they have no sites left, but often they will fit in a tent camper. If push comes to shove, I have always been able to find a room.\n\nMy second hack is to stay away from the interstates when possible. Take the secondary roads, there are a lot of cool little towns out there that aren't on the interstate. One 4th of July I rolled into a small town in North Dakota, stopped to get gas. The clerk mentioned that I was lucky because she was about to close and go to the Rodeo. I asked where it was and met some awesome people and had the best fourth ever. In Texas I found out about a high school football game, decided to go and it was a lot of fun.

Electrical outlets are prime real estate, and being the person who can extend the outlet to some-odd more people is being a hero. This might earn you some friends.\n\n2: often, campus coffee shops will give you free refills if you bring one of their reusable cups. (At least this was a thing at my university in the 2000s\u2026the shop was a Starbucks, which might also have something to do with it.) Make sure you get enough sleep, no matter how much caffeine you intake. In my freshman year, I worked myself to the bone and collapsed face-first in my lunch in what passed for the student common. One of the faculty practically carried me to his office, and told me to have a nap on his couch while he graded papers. This could have gone so badly\u2014students have been assaulted in less risky situations than that\u2014but I was a fat nerdy nobody. (Really lucky for it, too.) This guy left the door open, covered me with his jacket, and spent a couple hours ignoring my atrocious snoring. We don\u2019t all get the luxury of knowing we can trust people around us while we\u2019re sleeping, so make sure you can stay awake!\n\n3: BUG TRAPS. Not everyone on your floor will have the best hygiene and cleaning habits, and things tend to spread. Put bedbug detection traps in your furniture. Set glue traps under your furniture and by the doors. Check the traps regularly and watch for insect carcasses, kaka, and bites. If you do these, you\u2019ll get early warning in case a friend decides to share their pests.\n\n\nUNCOMMON sense tips for coursework. My grades were all over the place before college, but these tips got me put on the Dean\u2019s list, inducted in an honor society, and made classes easier. Most classes, I was the one passing with full score and extra credit, and I was the one people came to for help. These tips may not be necessary for everyone, but they got my disorganized easily distracted ass through with flying colors.\n\n1: You know those big deskpad calendars they sell, with the wide boxes for each day and a week per sheet? Get you one of those and _use it._ Every day after classes, notate your assignments on the calendar\u2014assignment dates, due dates, and if-this-isn\u2019t-done-finish-it-now dates. When you finish an assignment, don\u2019t move on until you\u2019ve checked it off on your calendar; if you don\u2019t see the assignment checked off, assume it isn\u2019t completed.\n\n2: To make it easier to know your class work, notes, etc. at a glance, color-code it. Use a different color ink for each subject, and choose the colors in a way that makes sense to you. (Bio\u2014green because nature. Philosophy\u2014blue because we can argue ethics until we\u2019re blue in the face and still never agree. Calculus/Trig/maths\u2014yellow because it makes you feel sick, or something. You get the point.) Highlight your notes in a corresponding color according to their subject, and find a way to flag your texts with that color, be it covers, labels, or \u2018flags.\u2019 Notate your assignments on your calendar in the color corresponding to the subject.\n\n3: as much as you can, study out of your room. Take advantage of libraries, study rooms, the cafe, common areas, you name it. Studying in your own space can bring distractions, and we subconsciously feel less pressured when on our own turf.
