You can charge pocket battery banks off of those. Direct charging to iOS devices, if it drops under 4.7V it'll say \"accessory not supported\" - so assuming your battery can normally charge it, use that method. Charge battery with solar. Charge phone with battery. \n\nGet some tri-fold solar panels and a small battery pack (small for solar use is about 15-20lbs). They fit in a backpack and charge for days on mere hours of exposure. That way you don't miss bills, and can call for help as well as status updates. \n\nThe Anker Powerhouse or Goalzero Yeti are good options. Both will power a CPAP or other small medical devices as well.\n\nI use my off-grid solar to charge my phone, tablet and watch on the campus at work. I'm not always near my desk or near power. Plug everything into my backpack. If I'm outside, unfurl the panels if I intend on staying for more than an hour.\n\n(2) Goalzero Yeti 150, (4) Goalzero Nomad 20, All fit in a very large Camelbak bag. Just north of $1k, $49 replacement batteries (standard commercial fire alarm size), sealed lead-acid so they're allowed on planes and vessels, and panels have a 10-30 year projected lifespan.\n\nThis is a good point to put all options on the table and start thinking about next time.\n\nYouTube has lots of results if you search for \"DIY solar generator\" if you don't mind scaling up in size and operating out of a car or truck - instead of backpack. They tell you what batteries to buy, which trickle charger, which inverter and which panels. Way cheaper than my off-the-shelf solution and mount in a storage container or crate on wheels. A couple of 100-watt panels and the right trickle charger could top off your vehicle battery if you don't plan on starting the engine frequently. Set up a large inverter and you can run small appliances or the A/C if all-electric. You would have to set up a cut-out switch to isolate the battery while charging, is all. \n\nAlso, check out ready.gov. They have some good information on items you'll need for various disasters.\n\nUltimately, think of disasters as mandatory camping. If you do that, you can easily identify potential needs and solutions.\n\nJust be careful in some municipalities not to overutilize an off-grid system. A nearby city adds $7,800/yr to your property tax if you decide to use your own rig instead of commercial power for more than half. For emergency or travel use, you'll be fine, as legal as a gas generator. This only applies to larger systems.\n\nGas generators are bulky, and odds are you'd already be displaced from your home before they could be run for their intended purpose. Gasoline, being stored underground, requires power to pump. That would be in short supply. \n\nIf you're a masochist, pick up a hand crank charger.", "score": 19, "author": "None"}, {"id": "dmt7ib1", "body": "...And P.S. if this is Austin I still love you.", "score": 16, "author": "BorecoleMyriad"}, {"id": "dmt6cec", "body": "**Homer**: Greetings, friends.

Words transport emotion like confidence and decisiveness, and it is important to realise they don\u2019t only convince your business partner, but yourself as well. Like OP said: how we phrase things influences how we feel, because being consistent in what we say and do has evolutionarily been a very important trait to be able to live together in larger groups.

This will shape their behaviour towards you, and they will treat you as an insecure person. So, what does it do to your sense of self-worth if you regularly receive feedback (verbal and non-verbal) from others that you are insecure? It goes down, and that makes you use even less positive language etc etc\n\nThe cool thing is, that you can easily change this vicious circle into a VIRTUOUS circle by changing language.

Every kidney stone i had needed to be removed surgically, which if you dont know that procedure..... its rough. Very very rough. Those stones DO NOT want to leave and they take their vengeance while being removed. 1st semester my grades (and finals) immediately took a hit. I couldnt focus due to the massive pain, kidney/ureter spasms, bloody urine, and the meds they put me on. I didnt inform my professors this time because i thought this would be a random one time thing.... then the end of second semester nears and BOOM stone #2. I get told it need to be removed again and my world feels like it falls apart. I cant tell you how fucked those surgeries make you feel, not to mention the financial stress as a new adult trying to get through college.

Only this time my professors didnt want to help. I had a Spanish 4 professor and her words to my face were, \"Its just kidney stones, ive had one before and i just passed it and went on with my life immediately after. Theyre not so bad.\".

The only professor to let me take my exam at a later time was my Geology professor and she didnt even want to, i had to beg. I loved that class and i loved the subject. I wanted to take that test. She said to me as well that maybe i should stop drinking (alcohol), while laughing. I at this time in my life did NOT drink alcohol. I failed that test afterwards. The college gave me academic suspension for a bad GPA. I took this opportunity to figure out why i was getting them.... conclusion? Urologist told me stress. It isnt super common to cause them straight up, but its the only thing he could think of for someone my age and my diet.... So i never went back to college and all my professors failed me except a couple who actually allowed me to reschedule tests.

I have a condition that makes my life very difficult & limited, and school presents many challenges for me. I sometimes have periods in which symptoms are more severe and it can be too much for me to attend class. There are certain things I cannot participate in, etc. \n\nWhen I was younger, I was embarrassed of my condition and was hesitant in speaking to professors about this. Several years back I adopted a method in which, regarding my condition, I will email and/or speak in person with with my professors at the beginning of every semester. I address the condition, my needs and limitations, the occasional absences that I might not be able to help, and we then proceed from there. Every professor has their own teaching style, which can vary, and I\u2019ve had different experiences with different professors. The common thread is that just about every professor i have had is understanding, wants to make sure I\u2019m comfortable and my needs are met, and is willing to be a bit flexible with me. We are usually able to work together quite cohesively in making sure my needs are met while not impacting what I am learning and getting out of the class. \n\nThis applies to more than physical health issues. I once had a discussion based class taught by a really cool prof. I met with her during office hours and told her that a) I have debilitating anxiety which impacts my class participation, and b) I just transferred, don\u2019t know anyone, and I feel very uncomfortable speaking up in class. She gave me the option of, should I not want to speak in class, answering the set of class discussion questions on my own time, written in word document, and turning that into her in place of speaking in class. This helped me transition and grow confidence organically. My learning experience was so much better and I got so much more out of the course than I would have if I was constantly anxious about speaking. The next semester, I took another discussion based course with the same professor, and I began speaking this time. I told her that she could call on me if she wanted, because sometimes I was too anxious to raise my hand. And she did start calling on me. Over time, I started raising my hand myself, I started feeling more sure footed. It had such a positive impact on my experience and development as a student and as a person. \n\nThe point is, talk to your professors. They want to know about it, whatever it might be. If they are a quality professor, making sure your needs are met in every aspect, educationally and otherwise, will be of utmost importance to him/her. I can say without hesitations that simply being open and vulnerable enough to let my professors in on my situation has had a tremendously beneficial impact on my experience and progression as a college student.

Both when they affect themselves and the world around them.\n\nI believe that by providing and reflecting this type of honest and open mind to kids, that they can learn by themselves.

Curious, I ask why because I really wasn't planning on fact checking my dad on a niche detail like that. Turns out he toured a water treatment facility in our area and learned a ton about where the water for this area comes from, how it's treated and the part he was most excited about: the engineering and design of different critical aspects of the plant (he's in construction and is in charge of a lot of aspects of the design and materials used. He's one of those people that get a percentage-based cut of the entire deal for the project, which is usually in the millions of dollars)\n\nSo I got to sit there and listen to like 30 minutes of **fascinating** stuff about where our water comes from, how civil engineers manage supply with demand, how they pick flow rates to affect sediment concentration, how the water I get to my house is actually from a completely different source than my other friend who lives 15 minutes away, how a couple cities in my area actually just buy their water from somewhere else and a lot of really other cool facts. Plus he corrected my understanding of something I was confident about but never fact-checked.\n\nI think he felt comfortable enough to \"nerd out\" with me because when he got a little excited and mentioned he toured a water treatment facility, **instead of dismissing what I might have thought was a boring topic**, I acknowledged his excitement and validated it by saying something like **\"I bet you know a lot of cool facts about that stuff now, right?\"** and he happily shared his passion about it with me.\n\nDon't tear people down who are excited about things that you find boring or even annoying.

The public transit system was over priced, didn't go every where, didn't run on weekends, or after 8PM, and the town was pretty stretched out too, and when you have to take about 7 transfers to go from the north side to say the far south or far west, it cuts how long you have available in a day TO volunteer, especially with how spread out all those organizations tend to be in my home town. The one a bunch of people wanted to do, which is animal shelters or dog walking, would have anywhere from a $40-$100 fee for becoming a volunteer, and sometimes kept hours that were bad for people who have to ride the bus for 2-4 hours (round trip) for people to come there, and I've personally seen more than a few people discouraged from volunteering because of that. \n\n\nVolunteering is amazing!

At the end of the day, I am tired and sore and stinky, but I feel good.  I know that I injected some good into the world, bringing joy to the dogs by getting them out of their kennels and into the sunshine.  The families sometimes post to the shelter's Facebook page with happy stories about how their dog is settling in to their family.  On my volunteer days, I know that I made a positive change in the world.

    {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "body": "I lost my wife a few weeks ago and received a whole lot of support messages. This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:\n\nThe first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.\n\nDo not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.\n\nIf the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it. One hundred people told me that I can call them whenever I need to talk, some of them specified \"even in the middle of the night\". It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all. So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:\n\nThis is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others. \n\nThe \"Do not, in any case\" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple \"sorry for your loss\". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.\n\nThe FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how \"anything\" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up.

A friend picked up my truck and repaired the clutch that had gone out the day before. My mom stepped in and dealt with bills, important phone calls, etc. my dad packed up my stuff and helped me move back in with my parents. My close friends picked me up and drove me around so I had someone to listen if I needed to talk. After the funeral was over and everyone else went back to their own lives I still had a few friends that took me on trips with them to get me out of the house and get my mind focused on something else. I went to GA, FL, IL, OH, and WV. At times I really felt like a bum, because even though my friends were the ones that invited me on these trips and offered to pay for everything, I knew I could never afford to repay them and I felt like a burden. I made those feelings clear and they did a great job of reassuring me that I was no burden and they were happy to do anything they could to make me feel better. \n\nOther things that helped me were people that brought food to the house, sat with me for a good cry, or went with me if I had to take care of things I knew would make me uncomfortable (paying hospital bills, paying for the headstone, etc). \n\nMy point to all of this is that actions, no matter how large or small, meant so much more to me than any words.

You should think of a bunny as a combination of a cat and a small dog. They're going to require more in the way of special care and attention than any small rodent you can pick up in the pet store. \n\nRabbits, on average, are going to cost more than any cat or dog you'll ever have. Their food costs are quite high for how small they are, they use a ton of bedding on a daily basis, and don't even get me started on what a sick bunny will cost at the vet. \n\nRabbits are extremely fragile and are absolutely *not* suitable pets for children. Grabbing, pulling, squeezing, even just holding the rabbit incorrectly can cause its very brittle spine, neck, or shoulders to break (they have a disproportionate muscle to bone ratio and can injure themselves by struggling or kicking too hard in an attempt to get away). In the same way that you wouldn't put a newborn baby in the hands of a four-year-old you should not give a small child a bunny because you think it's an \"easy\" pet; the bunny will only end up getting hurt.\n\nRabbits require regular routines and very careful monitoring to ensure they're healthy and happy. They can easily die from too hot or too cold temperatures, too much stress can cause them to go into shock and die, and if their eating habits are disrupted for even twelve hours at a time they can go into GI stasis and die. One day of neglect is all it takes to kill a bunny.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've had rabbits since I was a child (under the careful supervision of my mother and grandmother) and I have one now and I love him dearly, and I'm sure I'll continue to have them for the rest of my life, but they're a lot of work and they can easily live for ten-twelve years. This is not a commitment to take on lightly. So many rabbits end up in shelters because people don't understand that this isn't a toy, this isn't a fish where you can just throw some food in with it and call it good for the day, this is a very delicate, very sensitive creature that needs a lot of love and care. \n\nIf you hesitate at the thought of daily grooming sessions, daily cage cleaning, having your books/carpet/furniture/shoes chewed up, or a sudden emergency in the middle of the night where you have to take your bunny to the vet and shell out hundreds of dollars for care, then please, *please* get your kid a stuffed toy that won't suffer when they get tired or bored of taking care of it. \n\nRabbits are not toys.

If we continue down the path of blame, we can blame the event's organiser for enabling a disorganised team to fail to be properly equipped. Perhaps Joe can blame a parent, a late bus, or a failed computer. In turn the company who sold the failed computer, or the person driving the bus could be blamed. It goes on and on without resolution, each person finding reason that the blame should be shared.\n\nTo be accountable is to accept prior responsibility. If everybody involved is accountable, the likelihood of failure will decrease exponentially. Accountability is not a thing one should hold over another, but a duty one should go out of their way to accept. In your example there would be multiple failsafes employed to ensure there is never a single point of failure.\n\nIf this ethos is adopted, the outcome is the same as your advice. Accountability is not to be bickered over, but a burden to be shared. There's no need to squabble over it, as everybody involved is accountable. The only way forward is to seek a solution.\n\nOf course many people are lazy and insecure, and so the blame culture prevails.\n\nThere is a good book about the use of accountability in corporate culture: \"The Oz Principle: Getting Results Through Individual and Organizational Accountability\".

If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.\r  \n\r  \nKeep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.\r  \n\r  \nStretch.\r  \n\r  \nDon't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.\r  \n\r  \nGet plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.\r  \n\r  \nMaybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.\r  \n\r  \nEnjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.\r  \n\r  \nDance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.\r  \n\r  \nRead the directions, even if you don't follow them.\r  \n\r  \nDo not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.\r  \n\r  \nGet to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.\r  \n\r  \nUnderstand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.\r  \n\r  \nLive in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.\r  \n\r  \nAccept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.\r  \n\r  \nRespect your elders.\r  \n\r  \nDon't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.\r  \n\r  \nDon't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.\r  \n\r  \nBe careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.\r  \n\r  \nBut trust me on the sunscreen.", "score": 22, "author": "tjhcreative"}, {"id": "iv6381j", "body": "My method is sunscreen, moisturizer, retinol, AND Botox.

Had a great job when I was younger as a service Porter at a local dealership. Most everyone was cool, job was fairly easy going and honestly pretty sweet for a kid my age seeing as how I got to drive a bunch of different kinds of cars, and my boss (the head of the service department) is still my favorite boss and co-worker to this day (have had many jobs since). One day, was moving a rather large van, and accidentally scraped up against another van. Was hardly a big deal, just some marks on the front guard of the van I scraped (big plastic piece, no paint), the van I was moving was hardly touched, could\u2019ve probably wiped the marks off the guard. But, being still relatively the new guy (compared to others working there) and with an insecure and overly self-critical predisposition at the time, I was so embarrassed that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to man up and tell the truth. Even though my boss had repeated several times \u201cshit happens, just let us know about it\u201d. I just couldn\u2019t, despite all he had said, I felt like I had let him down. So of course the way to not let him down is to not tell him and wait for a customer to point it out! Jesus I was stupid. But wait, there\u2019s more! I got let off pretty easy, just sent home for the rest of the day for not telling the truth (dishonesty through omission). I took it as a 2nd chance, promised myself I would be extra careful and never let it happen again. Probably know where this is going. Not even 3 weeks after that (I had been working there issue-free for nearly 6 months prior to the first incident), I went to go move a car that someone had refueled near the on-site pump, didn\u2019t realize the wheel was still in the position to turn into the pump (all the way to the left), so trying to be efficient with my time (super busy), I got in and immediately went to reverse (my stupid ass didn\u2019t even notice the tires or register the fact that the wheel was turned, or I would\u2019ve known to return the wheel to standard position before moving). Of course, I wound up scraping the rear left panel into the corner of the posts around the pump that prevent people from hitting the pump itself. The corner of the post punched a nice, symmetrical hole through the panel. Looked like I had taken a hole punch to it. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I had done it again. This time, I figured since I had just done something similar 3 weeks prior, I\u2019d be fired regardless.

Genius I tell you. I still feel bad for lying to him to this day. Not that I fooled him or anything, obviously anyone could\u2019ve and did see right through me. It\u2019s just the guy was awesome, gave me a job, was someone I looked up to, so lying to his face was major disrespect. Just tell the truth guys.

    {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "body": "I came across this revelation not too long ago. I\u2019ve posted/commented on other subs about this struggle before. I realized many others related. When I was younger I was very passionate about, well, everything. In middle school I was already starting full-fledged businesses, in highschool I was teaching myself robotics + programming. Always wanted to work at startups, always wanted to be a part of something. But the key thing is: I would frown upon those that had no passion in life. I\u2019d use that quote over and over again about most men dying at 25 but being buried at 75. I could not wrap my head around someone wanting a peaceful life where they just want to settle down and enjoy themselves. I considered it an *early death*.\n\nFast forward a few years, and that\u2019s exactly what I wanted. My passion passed and I was prioritizing stability above all else. And I hated myself for it. I searched for ways to get back to my super motivated and passionate self. I didn\u2019t want to become that adult I swore I would never become. Some people told me it may be a mental illness, and it can be in your own situation, but that never ended up being the issue. Others said to just get my shit together and get disciplined. Which I did do, but I really just improved my health/lifestyle. I never got back to that feeling where it felt like I wanted success more than anything. Where it felt like I was breathing fire.\n\nSo, to sum it up, it took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that it\u2019s okay to prioritize stability as you get older. It\u2019s a part of growing up. Your priorities will change. I mean, if you\u2019re able to pull constant overnighters and run your own business at 35? That\u2019s great, good for you. But for most of us, that won\u2019t last forever. And that\u2019s okay. Or maybe it\u2019s the opposite case for you, where you currently want to be a single CEO or something while your past self wanted a nice big family. That\u2019s okay too. Your past self won\u2019t be disappointed in you, because your past self is a construct you\u2019ve made up in your mind. There\u2019s most likely no way to fully recreate your past mindset. Right now, you are your present self. And all that matters is what your present self prioritizes and wants in their life.\n\nPS: This is my first time posting here so I\u2019m not 100% sure if this belongs or if the flair is right.

This is probably the best comment I\u2019ve read in a while. \n\nPeople do not tend to understand this. We are taught that this is the wrong way to think. However, it is a feeling before it becomes identifiable and verbalized internally to one\u2019s self. \n\nIt will usually manifest in unhappiness or feeling like something isn\u2019t right. Everyone will be well intentioned and recommended seeing your physician, perhaps you\u2019re depressed (and yeah, sometimes you are also that), and others will absolutely ridicule you and talk shit about how you\u2019re blowing it, behind your back or to your face, and repeatedly so!\n\nWhat is tough is that they are taught to shame is for it and we are taught to feel ashamed for changing. \n\nSome people will be pretty affixed to who they are. Steady as she blows, no interruptions and pretty reliable and predictable in their behavior. \n\nGreat!\n\nBut I do kinda side eye people who cannot relax inside about themselves or others. Growing up means that you usually understand that the first thing in life that will matter is good health. Yours and for your loved ones. It trumps all else and finding out young sucks, but reorganizes out priorities correctly. \n\nSuccess is nice if you want it, but if you actually must have it, and must continue seeking it and repeating it or reaching higher benchmarks to meet the threshold for what measures success, then either you are a professional athlete, or you are a publicly traded corporation with sitting board members. Lol!\n\nHealthy self esteem will usually rid us of all of those shenanigans and poorly designed constructs which we no longer adhere to. The older we become, hopefully, the healthier our self esteem is. \n \nWhat is healthy self esteem?\n\nSimple: it is your inner voice. Your inner dialogue. It is your best friend, and it will not lie to you bit may have cognition deficiencies as all human beings do, but eventually, a strong sense of trust in that inner voice will always reveal to you what make you happy. And when you find that you are no longer afraid or ashamed about what others think or say, that\u2019s when you can safely assume, you have healthy self esteem. Not perfect, because there\u2019s no such thing and that is disorganized thinking presented as narcissistic personality disorder, but HEALTHY. Strong enough to take you to your next place. And it is actually a better feeling than success or accolades. \n\nNothing feels better than feeling good about your choices and following your heart. \n\nThe rat race is no longer enviable to me either. And while I\u2019m not going rogue and off grid like the unibomber, LMAO, I am certainly not interested in proving myself to anyone or even to myself. \n\nI understand that time is way more valuable than money and success. And you can get this realization as a wealthy/poor person who is 30 or as a wealthy/poor person who is 70. \n\nGood for you for understanding this and making yourself happy. One of the most successful persons I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of knowing realized this at the top of their career.  He was considered to be one of the best there is in his field, and while he actually is and that is rare because it just is, he ALSO had the press, accolades, awards and money to prove it. And he just wasn\u2019t into it the way his team told him he was supposed to be into it. So imagine the shit he got when he bought himself a house in the desert, and said to everyone, \u201cThanks! It\u2019s been fun. Maybe I\u2019ll stop by & work on some project every now & then...\u201d Everyone was baffled, myself included. However, he taught me one of the most valuable lessons I have ever learned in life: play the game, don\u2019t cheat, don\u2019t screw anyone over, including yourself... and know when to walk away. Life will go on with you there or without you there. Do you. \n\nI rarely ever hear about him in the trade papers, & when he does pop up, I know he ain\u2019t broke, but just feels like doing it because he wants to. \n\nGood for you. \n\nCapitalism destroys inner peace.

If you are *forced* to live in an environment that has abusive variables, it would be a lot more challenging to be in a happier mindset.\n\nTake for example if you have to live with someone who's like the reincarnation of Hitler. He enjoys belittling you. When he talks to you, he uses a very condescending, cold tone. You know, the type of tone that angry people use. Then this Hitler screams at you even when you do things right. He won't listen to your reasoning even if you have clear, factual evidence. He'll call you irresponsible, stupid, lazy, every bad thing possible even though you aren't any of those, and you have evidence to back it up. He'll try to gaslight you into believing you are the worst human being possible.\n\nNow the question, why won't you leave this place then? It's because you're unable to support yourself. How did this happen? Maybe you were on track with your career, but when you helped this reincarnation of Hitler when he was down on his luck (because he's a \"family friend\"), you allowed him to use your name to get a credit card, which he then did not pay, and thus your credit was destroyed.  Financial troubles made you take *any* job available because they were demanding you to continue \"sharing\" money with them despite the fact that Hitler already wrecked your credit. Now, this Hitler whom you've helped, is able to make lots of money, because you helped him financially and with legal documentation to allow him to be able to stay in America. Unfortunately for you, since you've allowed yourself to be used and commanded, your life is basically ruined. You're forced to live under this Hitler's new regime. \n\nWhy not fight with him? It's in order to keep peace at home. Why? Because he married a family member. You know how some women are. They like \"bad boys\", or at least those who are psychotic enough to seem \"nice\" in front of them, only to become a monster Satan when dealing with you.\n\nWhy not kill him? Although therapeutic, that's illegal. Oh and a family member actually \"loves\" him.\n\nAnd so the topic writer is definitely right. You can try to claw your way out of your hellish situation, but sometimes, the demon will simply pull you back for its amusement. You as a person, will have all sorts of emotional and mental scars, and the longer you stay with the demon in your life, the deeper and more painful they become. It's like trying to scoop out all the sand in the desert with a teaspoon, all the while the wind blows the opposite direction, completely nullifying and even worsening your situation.\n\nIf you cannot escape your hell, then you at least need something to make you happy, or at least find a way to express your unhappiness, your anger. You cannot always fight the demon head on, sometimes you are not even allowed to express your true emotions, because you want to keep the peace at home. But even in your own little way, even if nobody else will know, you need to do something.

    {"subreddit": "LifeProTips", "body": "That stain is NOT from a spilled drink. It's human waste (Urine and Feces). Gambling addiction is a serious issue that doesn't garner as much attention as it should. Many addicts wear adult diapers or pull ups so they can continue to play without needing to get up to go to the bathroom. Their addictions are so severe that they are willing to put themselves through what most of us would consider one of our worst nightmares. The workers at the Casino are not even allowed to confront someone defecating right in front of them (at least not where I worked).\n\nSometimes, If you take a good look at the stain, it becomes obvious that it is human waste. There will be two butt cheek marks on the chair with the waste forming around where the person was sitting. There will also be a stain right up the middle of the butt cheeks.\n\nThis is an issue in the poker room because they use regular non leather office chairs in these areas. Typically, slot machine chairs are protected with a material that repels liquids. This is because the chairs are attached to the machines and can't be removed. I worked for a few months as a custodian at a Casino and one of my daily tasks was pulling 5-10 stained chairs from the Poker floor  and using a carpet extractor with a handheld extracting attachment to remove the waste from the chairs. We then dried them out over night and returned them the next day to replace newly stained chairs. The Casino I worked at is a lower populated area. If it happened at my Casino, it happens at yours...\n\nUpdate: apparently not an issue at all casinos. Maybe just lower income areas? I am sure other casino workers will continue to comment and add info.

It tends to be something that they'll put off repeatedly as \"it's just part of ageing\" or \"I have other things to worry about\". Many people also think that there is a stigma to hearing loss and that hearing aids are very noticeable.\n\nHowever, there are links between hearing loss, dementia, and mental health issues such as social isolation leading to depression and anxiety. Having a hearing aid can help combat this as it helps the brain remain active. \n\nAlso, the sooner you get a hearing aid, the easier it will be in the future. This is because the part of the brain that processes sounds is very old (in the grand scheme of things) so if you've had hearing loss for a while then there will be sounds that the brain has forgotten how to catagorise. If you've gone without hearing fully for the past several years, get a hearing aid, and then are standing next to a road when a lorry goes past, your brain can freak out a bit as it immediately jumps to \"that loud, that predator, run away\", so it takes a few months to adapt and for your brain to learn to ignore known sounds again. The older you are the harder this can be.\n\nIf you are in the UK hearing aids are generally free (or have a very small charge) on the NHS and your GP can refer you for an appointment. All the aftercare, batteries, and tubes are free too. Your GP may also be able to use the AQP (any qualified provider) scheme to send you to a private audiologist as an NHS patient. You'll still get the same standard of care but it may be easier to get to and can decrease waiting times in some areas.\nSome people prefer to go private where the waiting times are massively reduced and there is more choice in styles, colours, and additions such as rechargeable hearing aids. This is also a valid option but private hearing aids can be EXTREMELY pricey and you have the ongoing cost of batteries and tubing.\n\nEdit - sorry for the long post, explaining this is part of my job and I can't help myself!", "score": 19, "author": "The-Shaffy"}, {"id": "hlusbam", "body": "I have hearing aids, but if you're from the US good luck paying for them.", "score": 35, "author": "CorrupterOfWords"}, {"id": "hlutzsp", "body": "I'm not deaf but I've always had problems with my ears since I was a wee lad.

I'm in my late 20s, but have been hearing impaired my whole life due to a hereditary issue. At 25, I decided to get hearing aids. I was being pulled into increasingly important meetings at work, I couldn't hear properly, and it was causing me levels of anxiety that were far beyond uncomfortable. I was angry, anxious, and depressed for a long time, unknowingly because of my hearing loss. Hearing my troubles and knowing my behavior for years supported the fact that I needed these to survive, my wife suggested I look into it. And I listened.\n\nGetting hearing aids was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my entire life. Being hearing impaired is one of those things where you don't know what you're missing until you hear it for yourself. To call it life changing is an understatement. I no longer rely on reading people's lips. I can talk at a whisper level now. I can hear conversations at the table in a loud crowded restaurant or bar. I can talk to my wife from a different room in the house. I can actually hear what's going on on tv without subtitles most of the time.\n\nI think a lot of people are worried about a stigma associated with hearing aids. As it only \"old people\" wear hearing aids, and it's uncool to wear them. Well, that's bullshit guys. If you need hearing aids, fucking get em. Stop wasting your life because you're worried people will think differently of you for having hearing aids. This is more directed at kids now, but anyone who looks down on you or makes fun of you for wearing hearing aids, you probably don't want to be friends with that kind of person anyway.\n\nIn short, if you need hearing aids, fucking get em.
