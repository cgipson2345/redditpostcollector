{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "Hi everyone, I am a international student so my writing might be off. However, since this forum helped me a lot, I am posting this to share some of my experiences.\n\nI am currently attending a middle-tier UC and my major is biology. At the beginning of the fall quarter, I somehow decided on doing a 19 units course load just to impress AO. My schedule was a nightmare and I won't lie. It's a combination of biology + chemistry honors+ lab+ writing+ upper-division philosophy + math (I thought this is going to be impressive). By the end of the first quarter, I ended up with a B grade in my chemistry lecture and a broken heart. I was so frustrated at the time because I saw most of the people are transferring with 4.0 while I don't even have a 3.9. But now I got in two T25 public and Barnard as a neuroscience major. The motivation for my transfer process is to get into a strong neuroscience program, and now I am very satisfied with my results. Transferring as a neuroscience major is so hard because everyone will kind of assume you are trying to get into med school. So I am very surprised when I got my decision, given that I got a B in Chem.\n\nHowever, having a B grade in chemistry is obviously bad decision-making and poor strategy. If I can go back to the past, I would not let myself do that kind of 19-unit weeder class course load again. I almost set my brain on fire and clearly jeopardized my mental health by worrying about my 3.8 GPA for 3 months. I panic so much because I thought I ruined my chance by having a B.\n\nPlease learn my lesson and don't try to show off in your course selection. No one will care how hard the class is. Get that easy A! AO will love to see 4.0! Just pick the class you can handle and don't challenge yourself too much. If you do end up with 3.8, don't panic. There is still hope!

If you get into Northwestern, that on its own is a target for IB because it doesn't have a designated business program, rather just a certification that you can get to be a part of kellogg (which I recommend you do).\n\nGoing to NYU CAS for econ is not good for investment banking because you get no access to the on campus recruiting that many firms do for Stern students, and you also don't get many other resources only exclusively offered to stern students.\n\nIf I were to choose between NYU CAS and Northwestern, I'd go Northwestern for IB/Finance.

So we have nothing to lose and everything to gain. \n\nAs decisions come up soon (within the next 20-30 days), I am excited to see what happens, but I also realize that I am a much better person than I was at the start of this transfer journey, and that it has helped me improve in ways that cannot be defined simply by acceptances/rejections. \n\nI hope this message can ease your guys' anxieties.

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "Ever since I\u2019ve been accepted, I have slowly grown to dislike this school more and more and I honestly feel terrible. \n\nTo start, it seems like this school isn\u2019t really respected like it used to be. I almost never see anyone on this subreddit talk about UW Madison, and other Midwestern public schools like UIUC and Purdue seem to outshine it. There\u2019s a whole laundry list of other schools of a similar or lower ranking that get talked about more, and honestly they seem a lot better. \n\nAnother major issue I have is with the student body. The student body of UW Madison doesn\u2019t seem really interesting or creative like many other colleges. It just seems like a bunch of frat people and alcoholics. One of the biggest things that made me excited for college in the first place was being able to meet creative and interesting people from unique backgrounds with amazing stories, and UW Madison doesn\u2019t seem to have this at all. I can tell I don\u2019t belong, but I would definitely belong at many other universities that I wish I had applied to instead. \n\nOne last thing that bothers me(not that important) is that the campus sucks. I went on a tour and I was amazed that this was considered one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation. It was a bleak, windy, concrete hellscape that made me feel depressed. It\u2019s almost like there\u2019s a grey filter on all the time in the city of Madison. No nice university feel at all, just buildings strewn everywhere. Maybe if this was nyc or la or something I\u2019d give it a pass, but it\u2019s literally a city in Wisconsin lol. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure what I should do now that I\u2019m committed. I am heavily considering transferring out, but im not sure how that will work. How likely is it for me to be able to transfer to another school of similar, higher, or even slightly lower ranking?

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "edit: here are my stats, thank you so much for all of ur comments!\n\nbtw, i was rejected from every. single. school. last year. I finished HS with a 3.5 unweighted gpa. dont ever give up!\n\nCurrent grade/age/school: current freshman at a very small southern state school. \n\nHS GPA: 3.5 UW / 4.9 W (I did IB, not submitting scores) I know this gpa is low, but I touch upon why that is in my essays. See below\n\nHS ECs (vauge so no dox) :\n\nCaptain of 2 teams for 3 years\n\nElected as a student liaison \n\nmanager for 3 years \n\nLearned lua/python/swift and sold a free module in lua to over 2k ppl (on some online game)\n\nWas a member of a sports club that went to national championships multiple times?\n\nI also know three languages?\n\nCollege Stats: PoliSci & Philosophy, minor in Math, pre-law track. I have a 4.0 GPA and took 6 courses (19 credits) both in the fall and spring. \n\nCollege ECs:\n\nInterned for one of my university\u2019s departments as a public relations intern. Worked 15 hours a week. Did this all throughout the fall semester. I didn't continue it in the spring.\n\nHave been interning at my school\u2019s human rights institute since the fall semester. I do research and write blogs/papers/etc. 5 hours a week.\n\nInterned at a non-profit organization that seeks to end global poverty as a political anaylsis intern. I conduct research, reach out to congressional leaders, and push people to be more involved with congress and what not. Been doing this since spring semester. 12 hours a week.\n\nWas one of the founding fathers of my school's first math club. Serving as treasurer for it now. Spring semester EC.\n\nWas a calc I/II tutor since my fall semester.\n\nOther: \n\nHoping that taking 19 creds both fall and spring semester, and maintaining straight As in both semesters, shows that my 3.5 GPA in HS is not a reflection of me.  I also hope that I stand out cus im pre-law liberal arts dude who is also minoring in math. Took Calc 2 fall semester and Calc 3 currently. A in both.\n\nEssays (IMPORTANT FOR CONTEXT!):\n\nMy essays were all circulated around how during my junior year of HS, I had to be the leader of my family because my mom got rlly depressed and I had to step up and make sure we didnt deteriorate. I basically talked ab how I had to make sure my family avoids homelessness, as both of my 2 brothers have learning disabilities and my mom (who is single and severely depressed) could not take care of our family. \n\nI hope that helps make sense of my 3.5 GPA. Also prob helps that I have had a 4.0 gpa since fall semester and have taken as many courses as my college lets me (or so I hope?)\n\nRecs: \n\nreally good, I hope. Got three in total. One from my HS coach who can vouch for my family\u2019s situation and two from teachers I had last semester and this semester again. \n\nApplying to:\n\nNorthwestern, Dartmouth, USC, Vanderbilt, Tufts.\n\nAccepted to thus far: unc, tulane, and cornell now : )\n\nRejected: Uchic TED (I need aid so no surprise)", "title": "I JUST GOT INTO CORNELL FOR CAS", "id": "12yr1bf", "score": 90, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12yr1bf/i_just_got_into_cornell_for_cas/", "permalink": "/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12yr1bf/i_just_got_into_cornell_for_cas/", "author": "constantfresh", "comments": [{"id": "jholinx", "body": "Stats/ECs?", "score": 16, "author": "PineappleUprising"}, {"id": "jhoo08j", "body": "CONGRATS!!

I am a high school senior who applied for CS and I didn't get into schools I want to actually go to. My best schools in terms of CS ranking in the country are Purdue and UWM. I don't have the greatest grades as a CS major due to freshman and sophomore year(covid) so I was surprised I got into Purdue. I also am taking both AP CS classes this year which happen to be my first ones. I don't really have much ECs for CS since I recently became interested.\n\nAbout a month ago my friend introduced to me the idea of transferring from a CC. He told me about the many pros of taking this path. For example save money, have a better chance of getting in a good school, online classes, more flexible. For the last month or so, I have been doing research about this route and it seems pretty nice. The thing I like most about it is the ability to take online classes and having a better shot at the more selective schools. If I were to take this route, I am prepared and motivated to grind ECs and GPA as hard as possible. Some schools on my list as of now are NYU, USC, UNC, UCLA, UCB, UCSD,UCSB, and any ivies with Columbia being at the top.(Still doing research)\n\nShould I attend Purdue and drop my goal of attending a top university?\n\nOr\n\nShould I attend CC?

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "Howdy y'all essentially the title says it, I am 22 and am currently in my final semester at Austin community college, and am looking to weigh my chances in different directions.\n\nFor starters we'll talk about highschool first, AP student (6 or 7 AP tests average above 3.75 on them) 1390 SAT, 31 ACT, no class rank because I essentially finished my senior year online through a program which allowed me to graduate early(not in the idealistic way but because I had undergone some unrelated problems outside of school). Athlete as well, but nothing significant. \n\nThen my first attempt at college, took a semester at UCCS as a declared double major in physics and philosophy and subsequently flunked essentially straight F's, though I did receive a sympathy C- in my first year honors course. Which yes I was in the honors program, and I even found my way into the student government as a senator. After this semester I took the spring off, moved to Denver and went to CUD because they were same family of university I was able to transfer despite my gpa, for a summer semester which was also covid summer. If I recall correctly I wound up with a 3.5 gpa that semester. \n\nNow the reason why I think I even have a chance despite the less than ideal start; after the summer I subsequently checked myself into a rehab, and will soon be celebrating two years sober. Once back in the real world back home ish in Austin one of the first things I did was register for ACC. Since doing so I have maintained a 4.0 whilst double majoring in physics and economics. I am a member of the honors program, and a few other honors societies, I will graduate an honors scholar. I have received the chancellors honor's award for graduating with perfect GPA, \"the highest academic award given at acc.\" I have also worked the entire time, at some nicely named companies, Tesla, GoogleFiber, and will intern at Dell this coming summer. I have a decent amount of volunteer hours at habitat for humanity. Overall I'd say my resume is decent and I can write some damn good essay's though I don't know how much that matters now that I'm competing with ai. \n\nThat being said I applied to UT Austin for transfer and feel really good about my chances of getting in. But given my circumstances I can't help but feel like had I not fucked off as a kid I would be at one of the big name privates or Ivy leagues. So I kinda wish I had put more effort into building a perfect application for Columbia or University of Chicago, where I may have had a chance with the right application. Instead I'm a bit bummed out that I was so meticulous and put so much energy into my UT application, mainly as a result of all the teachers and advisors constantly reminding the students here about how \"competetive\" it is, (fair warning I know what I'm about to say is largely egotistical) but it's honestly probably not that competitive for me I mean had I just gone to school my senior year of hs I would have graduated top7% of my class and would have been automatically admitted to UT. And so for the majority of kids whom find themselves at acc expecting to transfer to UT it's difficult and competitive bc they didn't have the \"juice\" to get there right off the bat. And same goes for me but I can't help but think that I had plenty of juice, so much so I split it and made a big ole mess lmao. \n\nSo here I am, graduating with a couple associates degrees in less than a month, having only applied to UT, and with most if not all fall transfer applications for the big names closed. Wondering what is my best plan of action. Spoiler alert: it's probably just go to UT because it's in state and I can semi afford it.

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "Hi all, I'm relatively new to this forum and am hoping to get some feedback on my transfer application from anyone who's applied or already attends.\n\nFor some context, I pursued a music degree at a fairly large private university and decided to drop out after 3 years and switch tracks to Industrial Engineering. For the last year I've been enrolled in a community college taking some standard technical courses such as calculus, engineering physics, and chemistry. Until I switched tracks, most of my activities were music related, so I don't have any sort of \"engineering background\" of research or robotics clubs of the sort that others have had. Nonetheless, I'm super interested in IE and already have several ideas of what settings I'd specifically like to work in.\n\n1) Grades:\nUniversity (former): 3.9 uw,\nCC (current): 4.0 uw\n\n2) Test scores: My SAT/ACT scores back in high school were abysmal (at least by NU standards) and I haven't retaken since, so I decided to take the test optional route. (my high school grades were ok, but I'm worried that it might reflect poorly on my app)\n\n3) Essays: I took a less personal approach on the common app statement, and focused more on why specifically I wanted to do Industrial Engineering and what about the career interested me. I also submitted the \"Why Northwestern\" statement explaining why I wanted to join a certain club at NU. I've gone back and forth in my own head about whether or not this was a good path to take, but at the time I was writing my essays it seemed like the most reasonable route to take. I'm curious to hear what approach others have taken.\n\n4) LOR:\nI requested two recommendations from CC teachers whose classes I performed well in this year (chemistry and math). They seemed to have a positive reception of me and I'm pretty confident they were good letters. One of them  got his doctorate from NU, I wonder if that's something that would boost my cred with the AOs.\n\n5) Activities: Aside from an engineering club I joined at the beginning of this year, I listed about 5 activities total that were mostly related to music, either in or out of my former university. This included teaching, performing, and mentoring. I also participated on a diversity taskforce (DEI) that actually surveyed students on systemic racism or other forms of discriminatory patterns and reported feedback to the school's administration. There were probably some other activities I could have included, but I didn't feel like they were relevant or significant enough to actually brandish on my application. IDK.\n\n6) Awards/honors: Made the dean's list about 6 times and also another award from CC for my 4.0 in the Fall semester. Included a music award from high school as well.\n\nI don't have legacy status but know a number of friends, relatives and even coworkers that go or have gone to NU at some point. I'm not intending on this being a \"chance me\" post but I'd really appreciate any feedback or blanket opinions on the how realistically NW would accept a student like me.", "title": "Northwestern Questions", "id": "12y8czt", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12y8czt/northwestern_questions/", "permalink": "/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12y8czt/northwestern_questions/", "author": "ChiefSmexy", "comments": [{"id": "jhmalbb", "body": "I feel like your personal statement approach is good as long as its well-written (I know plenty of ppl that did the same with the create-your-own prompt), but your \"why NU\" essay might be a little weak.\n\nDid you only talk about the one club in the \"why nu\" essay? Maybe I'm off but my initial take there is you don't really have a lot that interests you about NU specifically. Clubs can be created, and unless this is some incredibly unique/special club that only NU has (maybe it is idk correct me if it is), you can find the same thing at 50 other schools. Also, it doesn't really address what about NU interests you academically. Sure you'd join a club, but are you not excited about X class with Y professor, or Z unique curriculum opportunities, or to engage in A research that NU has a great focus on, etc.?\n\nAnyways that's just my 2 cents. Outside of that you're looking alright. Your music ec's seem pretty cool but how good they are depends on their scale (e.g., did you mentor 50 musicians over 2 years or 3 over a couple months, did you perform in front of 10 students one time or 100+ people several times, etc.). Test optional is nothing to worry about since you're so far removed from HS and your HS record will be basically irrelevant. The LOR doctorate thing won't boost you.\n\nEdit: Also, your situation is super unique so I don't know if this even applies to you because you went from a 4-year to a CC, but actually I'll include it here just as a heads up. NU has a strong preference for 4-year transfers. They stated that they typically only have around 10 cc's enroll each year and I don't imagine they admit many more", "score": 2, "author": "Budget_Antelope7854"}, {"id": "jhqutjj", "body": "Imo you have an interesting story, so you definitely have a shot.

However, it\u2019s not very well-known (except that it apparently looks really good for grad schools\u2026it\u2019s apparently also very rigorous) and the total enrollment size is really small (like 300). In case I end up hating it (preparing for the worst) and want to transfer elsewhere for my sophomore-senior years, will my HS GPA allow it? I think my missing year of academic classes was the primary reason I was rejected, but my high school record is a bit complicated.\n\nFreshman year - 4.0 One AP, one dual enrollment class, five regular classes\n\nSophomore year - Would be a 4.0 except for a C in AP Physics 1st semester and a B the next semester. My major is in the social sciences and I took AP Euro and AP Comp Sci that year too\u2026hopefully these outweigh. Also an A in another dual enrollment class\n\nJunior year - over summer I was diagnosed w/ a chronic illness and my doctors advised me not to have a stressful course load, so I only took 5 classes. 3 AP - Psych, calc, and english lang - and 2 regular. Again, would be a 4.0 except for my AP Stem class, which I got a B in. \n\nThis semester I might also get a B in calc, and that would lower my overall 3.9 to a 3.8.\n\nThe schools I would want to transfer to are HYS, Vandy, and Cornell. I could maybe consider Emory or Trinity. \n\nI have a strong preference for private schools, but I heard they prefer sophomore transfers. What if my HS GPA is not competitive enough for that?\n\nCould a really strong SAT make up for that? I didn\u2019t take it before but I might this summer\u2026\n\nPlease help \ud83d\ude2d", "title": "Is this a good hs gpa?

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "I\u2019m a second semester sophomore studying public health (non-premed) at an Ivy League and want to transfer to do public health at a different Ivy League or t25. I originally matriculated to this program because it was the only Ivy League I got into (I got into other t25) and one of the few schools with a bachelors degree in public health. They also pay the majority of my school fees. I\u2019ve had a really tough time here since first semester freshman year (no friends, constantly ill, etc) but hadn\u2019t applied to transfer since the school was paying the majority of my fees. However more and more I\u2019m realizing this school is not my fit and it\u2019s affecting me academically. Right now I\u2019ve realized that even if I took the max amount of credits each semester I wouldn\u2019t meet the requirements to graduate. This particular major in my college calls for a lot more required courses and especially premed science courses, even if you\u2019re not premed. A lot of people end up internally transferring to a different major (you\u2019d think I\u2019d have taken it as a sign to transfer sooner \ud83d\ude05). I struggle very heavily in science courses and there\u2019s major grade deflation. I currently have 3.5 but I\u2019m worried it will drop lower as a result of these courses. I\u2019m in ogro and cellular bio and have a low grade in each class. Unfortunately I still have a lot of science courses to go when that is not my personal interest in public health (interested in SDOH, racial disparities, nonprofit/community work). Lastly, I\u2019m disabled and struggle with chronic illness. The environment and general inaccessibility here have exacerbated my symptoms. And I\u2019ve struggled to take over 13 credits in any semester so far. Right now I\u2019m considering multiple options to discuss with my advisor:\n1. Transferring internally- I\u2019ve considered transferring to a different college within my university to maybe study sociology as I\u2019ve taken a significant amount of courses for the major as part of my health equity minor. However, I wouldn\u2019t be getting the public health degree, just a minor, and I don\u2019t know how it would affect mph admissions. Addition my public health degree secured me internship at Mayo Clinic so I don\u2019t how not having it would hinder future opportunities \n2. Going through student disability services to reduce required credits-again i don\u2019t how it would affect mph applications\n3. Potentially transferring externally-I know most schools don\u2019t take students who have taken more than four semester by enrollment. I\u2019m about to complete my fourth semester. Would taking a gap semester, gap year, or leave  of absence and then applying help with this?

I\u2019m here to ask for advice on what I should do in cc and how I should go about this journey.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m essentially asking is it best I apply after freshman year of cc to all of the schools or do I have to complete a certain amount of credits or prerequisites? \n\nI plan on applying to UC\u2019s but I\u2019m asking specifically for Ivy\u2019s.", "title": "High school senior that\u2019s wants to transfer from cc to top 20.", "id": "12rgwc8", "score": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12rgwc8/high_school_senior_thats_wants_to_transfer_from/", "permalink": "/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12rgwc8/high_school_senior_thats_wants_to_transfer_from/", "author": "Representative_Two57", "comments": [{"id": "jgwl2vu", "body": "I had a mediocre GPA in hs but changed it around in college.

As one of my school's academic policies states that first-year grades are not included in GPA calculations or official documents (such as official transcripts), I decided to send my unofficial transcript (which includes my first-year grades) along with my official one to the schools I'm applying to, as I feel that providing only 1 semester of grades as a second-year student would probably not be a good look for my application.\n\nTwo days ago, a USC AO emailed me to inform me that some grades were missing from my official transcript (I'm guessing these were my first-year grades, which would only appear in my transcript with an \"SC\" for \"Successfully Completed\"). However, they then emailed me a few minutes later to tell me that there was no problem with this due to my school's first-year grades policy.\n\nSince this probably means that the schools I'm applying to haven't received my unofficial transcript (and thus, my first-year grades), should I bother with sending it now (especially since some schools are probably gonna be releasing decisions very soon)?\n\nOn one hand, without my first-year grades, my GPA is a 3.917, although it doesn't account for a particularly challenging coursework (the only \"hard\" classes I took during that semester were a Computer Systems and a Linear Algebra class).\n\nBut on the other hand, with my first-year grades, my GPA is a bit lower at 3.895, but it does account for all of the coursework I did (including some of the \"hard\" classes I took during my first year such as a Design & Analysis of Algorithms class).\n\nI know this is a bit specific, but if anyone has ever transferred from a school with a similar first-year grades policy, please let me know what you did in your case!\n\nThank you!!!", "title": "First-Year Grades not in Transcript", "id": "12jlkrj", "score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12jlkrj/firstyear_grades_not_in_transcript/", "permalink": "/r/TransferToTop25/comments/12jlkrj/firstyear_grades_not_in_transcript/", "author": "Edgar2608", "comments": []}

I came in pre-med and I will say that compared to UVA, I think VCU has more resources for incoming STEM students that allow them to adjust to college a little bit easier. VCU has supplemental instruction sessions for classes with the lowest pass rates, including introductory bio, chemistry, orgo, etc. These are highly beneficial. I believe UVA offers tutoring, but I think these sessions were incredibly helpful. I feel that Richmond may offer more than Charlottesville in some aspects; there are a lot of different areas you can scribe, translate, volunteer because of the diversity of Richmond that might not be available in Charlottesville. The first semester honors college courseload was definitely pretty hard; I felt like I had more work than my friends at UVA because I was taking eight classes (including labs). The grading system at UVA is more difficult because an A- is a 3.7 and a B- is a 2.7 (if you had straight B-s, you\u2019d be on academic probation), and you would have to take a language for four semesters. You shouldn\u2019t have to take a language at VCU. I might be the only one offering this about VCU, but I genuinely think it\u2019s a better option for pre-medical students than UVA. Getting into medical school is only getting harder, and VCU also has the early assurance program you can apply to your sophomore year and have guaranteed acceptance in their medical school (it is very competitive though). However, UVA does have more prestige and that may hold more power in other aspects, especially if you decide to do something else. But a BA in psychology from either VCU or UVA won\u2019t get anybody very far. I could definitely see going to UVA and then transferring if you\u2019re unhappy, but I felt like the support VCU had for incoming students honestly wasn\u2019t comparable to what UVA offered.

I am looking to attend a university with a proficient and rigorous cognitive science program. Cornell, Rice, and Brown are among the top that I am applying to. There is one issue, however. In 2020, I attended Texas Tech University and ended up Dropping out. I basically failed a majority of my classes, I was suffering a terrible mental health crisis and couldn't even get out of bed. So, after a few months, I decided to give school a chance again. For context, I did very well in High School. I was the captain of my dance team, Editor of the yearbook, and took several AP courses. I also had a 3.6 and was in the top 20% of my class. I am aware that the odds are against me, however, I've heard a multitude of stories about students who didn't do well at their primary institution, yet managed to attend top universities.\n\nWhen I transfer, I will have completed four semesters of Community College. Below are all the activities I've had at my current community college. Also, I have two w's on my current transcript (sigh). I would appreciate your opinions.

I was at the proverbial fork in the road in my military career, the 10-year mark. I could either get out now or \u201ctough it out\u201d until retirement. I decided that a military retirement wasn\u2019t for me and started looking for plan b. After some soul searching and exploring my options I decided I\u2019d apply to some top schools and try to find my next career. At that time, there was only one school in California that I could apply to given that I only had a few college credits. This went awry for various reasons, not the least of which being that I had a dubious academic record. I just barely graduated high school and even had a few \u201cF\u201d s in there. I also didn\u2019t lean on the resources I had available to me as much as I should\u2019ve and ended up with bad essays, too. My narrative was all over the place as I was still trying to unpack a lot of things myself.\n\nAfter being rejected from that school, I decided to spend the time to take an honest stock of where I\u2019d been, where I was, what I care about, and where I want to go from there. I spent about six months reflecting, brainstorming, and paying close attention to how I thought and felt about everything, and I think that process was the key to writing much stronger essays. I also started going to school full time and I will have just about completed my associates at the end of this term with an overall gpa close to 4.0. For better or worse, I feel much better about what I submitted this time around as I was able to add several schools to my list and I told my story as best I could.

Here, however, is where my issue arises. \n\nI am not completely certain whether or not I should apply to other colleges next year (During my freshman year) or not. I will end highschool with a 3.8 GPA and all the top ivies I applied to I applied SAT test-optional because I am anxious test taker and I only felt myself gradually get worse on the SAT with my anxiety in play (and in comparison to the average Ivy league applicant, my score is weak). If I re-apply to all top schools, I don't know if it would be better to submit an SAT score, and if yes, then I'd have to invest time into preparing for the SAT *again.* I also felt like I had decent ECs, but now I think that even if I did anything this year to better them, AOs would see it as doing it solely for the application. \n\nI don't really know how much I can change  my application in 10 months. A 3.8 also is not that impressive, and if I omit SAT scores, I might as well have my (already very slim) chances reduced to 0. All the ivies (except for Harvard, Cornell, and Dartmouth) are relatively close to where I live. BU isn't that far either, but I'd like to be closer to home. After all I went through in highschool (at a \"prestigious\" and insanely exhausting school), I just want to feel like all my time and effort didn't go to waste which I'm not feeling too good about right now. \n\nI know that it would probably be better to apply in 2 years, but then I don't want to go from state school to BU to anywhere else (in the hypothetical chance I get in) OR skip out on BU, stay at my state school just to apply in 2 years and then not get in. I also am very aware that ivies and other top schools primarily accept community college applicants and veterans of which I am neither, so all-in-all, I don't know if all my overthinking here is wasted. \n\nI'm hoping any of you can shine a light on whether applying as a transfer student next year is a good/smart option or maybe in 2 years. I don't know, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and lost.

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "Top Choices: **Duke, Brown, Northwestern, UChicago** (potential for others, but these are the ones that are my dreams. I know chances are always super low, but I truly believe anything is possible!)\n\nI'm currently a freshman at Vanderbilt Univeristy, as a math and human & organizational development major, looking to potentially transfer fall of my junior year (2024). I started off with a low GPA but am on track to have a 3.7+ GPA after this semester, with a solidified GPA of at least 3.8 by the time I'd apply. I've received A's in every math and stats class I've taken. The reasoning behind my desire to transfer is for a variety of social reasons and the fact that my school does not offer a statistics major, which is a subject I am falling in love with.  In addition, as a low-income student, being in an urban setting does not give me many affordable/free things to do outside of school. I feel as the SEC greek life and drinking culture does not fit my vibe, and there isn't many things to do that don't revolve around drinking and clubbing. The deep south culture has also been challenging, as I have received many racially motivated comments and even (drunkedly) been called racial slurs on occasions. \n\nThe reasoning behind my choice for each school is that (1) they offer a stats major, with is a concentration of math I love much more than the pure math. Vanderbilt just doesn't offer many stats classes. I visited Duke, and the vibe I got showcased a much greater sense of community in the suburban setting, and it seemed as there were many more resources for students to genuinely enjoy life, even if they aren't in GL. I just fell in love. For Brown, I love the open curriculum, in addition to the much less emphasis on GL, so students can branch out more easily and do things that are much more fulfilling to the spirit. For UChicago and Northwestern, I know both have GL, but I love that they are much closer to home (<1.5 hours away), and that they are just 20 minutes away from a lot of family I have in the Chicagoland region. Overall, Vandy academically and socially just has not been much of a fit, and the reason I didn't apply as a transfer for my sophomore fall is that I just didn't have the GPA or extracurriculars. \n\n**Some clubs and extracurriculars I'm in include:**\n\n\\-an international consulting club, that is looking to find investors to invest in a nonprofit water access company in Kenya\n\n\\-currently part of a research team for an ongoing study to create Vanderbilt's first student price index\n\n\\-Culinary Club (for fun because I love cooking!)\n\n\\-Vanderbilt Reformed Undergraduate Fellowship (to stay in touch with my faith)\n\n\\-Starting in fall 2023, I've been accepted into an on-campus desk job at the student life centers\n\n\\-Mexican American Student Association\n\n\\-Over breaks I work 20 hours a week as a crew member at my town's dunkin donuts, and will continue to work this summer. In addition I plan to continue volunteering at church, as well as take two summer classes. \n\n\\-in Fall 2023 i'm looking to branch out into more competitive clubs and hopefully assume a leadership position\n\n**Demographics: Some things about me**\n\nI'm the first in my family to go away to college, in addition to being a first generation-american. I'm a Latino (mexican) male, coming from quite a low-income household with a single mom and two other siblings in college.

{"subreddit": "TransferToTop25", "body": "**TL;DR** \n\nI'm a 25 year old dude from a major city looking to start at a CC and transfer to a competitive (or even just above average) school for career opportunities and my interest in high performing academics. I have no prior credits and am basically a clean slate with \"*meh\"* to \"*good luck\"* high school stats. What to do/starting advice?\n\n**DETAILS**\n\nHello people, I'm just lurking on this subreddit curious about some options I may have. Not sure where I'd fit into this whole picture given my circumstances. I've read the wiki and I guess I'd need some guidance/advice on what to do. I'll go in order of background and the wiki.\n\nFor background, I'm looking at beginning at a local 2-year college in my area (major US city college system) in order to go to school and finally pursue my education. I've previously wanted to do a ASN/ADN (two year nursing degree), but it's honestly not my passion. I've been in this field as a nursing assistant for three/four years now. I'm 25 years old (I feel ancient compared to some of you newly minted high school graduates). I have no prior college courses under me.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some career/major interests, my high school stats, and WIKI considerations.\n\n* **MAJORS**: Government/Political Science, Public Administration, International Relations, Economics, Public/Global Health, Philosophy, History; including a foreign language in either Spanish (previous high school language), Russian (personal interest), French/German (scholarly interest).\n* **CAREERS**: Intelligence Analyst, Economic Analyst, Foreign Service/Affairs Officer, Economist, Political Scientist, Post-secondary Educator/Researcher, Archivist, Government Researcher, International NGOs, United Nations Officer, Public Health Analyst, International/Immigration Law, Library Sciences, Healthcare Administrator\n* **HIGH SCHOOL**: 3.592 GPA (weighted), 28 ACT (composite). Varsity Swimmer, LGBT+, otherwise decent student.\n* **ECs**: Given that I'm a healthcare worker, LGBT+, and interested in languages/international, and policy issues, I was thinking of doing a project of \"impact\" in my local area for LGBT+ health initiative outreach involving non-native English speakers with limited proficiency. Specifically in HIV/PrEP, PEP access, and gender affirming care. I'd likely focus my efforts on this while at the CC in addition to my current job and studies (may even find a way to overlap these). As far as small projects/side things for fun, I enjoy writing and music composition/production (but that's just for fun). \n* **ESSAYS**: I like to think I'm a decent writer. And based on everything written here, I think I have a half-way decent story to tell, pending the ECs. I'd likely emphasize the reach, resources, alumni network, and scholarly potential at the T25 schools for essay purposes in my transfer decision.\n* **LORs**: I haven't taken college courses yet, but I get the idea from this. \n* **STATS**: See above for high school. My goal for CC is in the 3.8 + range. I've always been a decent to damn good student depending on the subject, but I know higher education is different given the time to effort commitments. \n* **#MISC**: I'm honestly not sure what to do with this information. One or two years based on what you've read? Financial considerations are also important, as I really don't like accruing debt in the name of an education (I would likely source outside scholarships, rely on institutional aid, and god forbid private loans).

This trend is true for almost all universities. The decrease in acceptance rates is best explained by the rise of Common App and shotgunners, not a change in admissions criteria.

Additionally, the old SAT was much more resistant to practice and preparation than the new SAT. Scores back then were nearly impossible to increase, yet today almost anyone can increase their scores by hundreds of points.

I just found out last week after visiting the office in person on 3/27 that it did not go through because apparently, I didn't fill it out correctly even though I emailed it to the admissions and records office on 3/14.\n\nI just submitted the forms in person a week ago and they said it would take a week for the forms to be processed and mailed since my college does not do emails for the college report which is weird since it could be so much easier that way.
