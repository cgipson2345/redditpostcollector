I did my best to keep the conversation going but every topic was like trying to pull teeth. We still text every once in awhile but I really didn't make a relationship type connection with her, and it sounds shallow but I just didn't find her attractive like that.

I get the issue is the pay model and people shouldn't be obliged to tip in the first place, but its how it is and i personally can't do anything about it. but if youre gonna willingly use a service knowing damn well its something you tip for when you receive good service, (and I know I give good service, always arrive early, and am very communicative with a positive attitude) if I give you above average and quick service damn right I expect a tip.

This is largely an unused determination outside of corporate exchange, primarily drive-thru or dining-in-vehicle methods, or DIVs.

Especially if you consider more modern slang like blinking things into existence from games and such (final fantasy had a spell called blink, which causes the target to have high revasion due to the illsuik of them blinking between a few locations rapidly, and also in things like Magic the Gathering blinking means to remove a creature and return it shirtl or instantly afterwards to protect or proc an ability).", "score": 1, "author": "rileyvace"}, {"id": "fqx5du0", "body": "Winkin Blinkin and Nod", "score": 1, "author": "Dogtownnative"}, {"id": "fqx5iht", "body": "Thanks, i hate it", "score": 1, "author": "HarshaPhoenix2"}, {"id": "fqx5nb7", "body": "DouBLe Wink.

Proteomics aims for completeness. The proteome of a single human cell, which might contain billions of proteins, is sometimes compared to an atlas. It can guide geneticists or drug companies to early markers of a disease, or to the precise mechanism of aging, or to promising targets for cancer treatment. The field has been made possible by spectacular advances in data analysis and in lab instruments, which become cheaper and more powerful each year.

From this point on, when I think of you, I will imagine a diseased turtle taking an enormous dump, with so much unbelievably large amounts of shit that all the protons inside of the methyl sulfide this horrendous crap contains spontaneously fuse into uranium-235 that I can use to shove a nuke up your sub-mental ass. You can write that off as an exaggeration but it is 100% true from the bottom of my already-empty heart. I legitimately think that you lack intelligence. I would say you're mentally unstable but then I couldn't blame the terribly ignorant fucking post on you. I literally cannot comprehend how amazingly dimwitted your dumb ass is. I have trouble understanding the laws of physics, space, and time as if all laws of reality have been devastated and disintegrated due to how dense you are. I could write a damn book on your lack of intelligence that is so long, one could read the entire Series of Unfortunate Events series, watch the entire Godfather trilogy, and invent fucking time travel itself before it could even be published under a first edition. Half-Life 3 would be released centuries before I could finish the first chapter describing your purely pointless state of mind. I honestly cannot tell if you were abused too much or not abused enough, because you clearly did not go to school enough to get a proper fucking education. To quote George Washington, \"Associate with men of good quality if you esteem your own reputation; for it is better to be alone than in bad company.\" In that case, I'm getting as far away from you as possible. Hell, I'm actually unironically considering moving to Macquarie Island just to be isolated from your brain cell-killing words for the rest of my now-miserable life. I would rather go insane from thinking about you to the point where I pull a Cast Away and consider sexual relations with a volleyball than actually spending time anywhere near you. There is honestly no other way of putting it; you're an irritating asshole who contributes absolutely nothing to this already dreadful planet. And that's saying a lot considering the fact that I've heard of carbon dioxide levels reaching 400 parts per million, Donald Trump becoming president, and toxic fucking comment sections that contain your stupid bullshit. And again I go, being confused by whatever quantum physics you are using to defy the laws of physics with your stupidity, to the point where I'm saying you are worse than yourself. I have nothing else that is most definitely as horrible as you to compare to except you yourself. How does that make you feel? Like a turtle taking a nuclear shit? I really don't have a single shit to give anyway, because you are living proof that there is no hope for humanity left. Really went downhill after that whole thing where Rome fell; that made a lot of people pissed off. But not as pissed off as I am after reading your stupid shit. No, buddy, if I should even call you that, I am not pissed off at your comment. I am FURIOUS. I am so furious that I will personally take that radioactive turtle shit myself just so I can rid the world of your baffling levels of unadulterated doltishness. You are more dull than oxygenated magnesium or even a samurai sword that hasn't been sharpened for a thousand years. And you better be glad that the sword is dull, because if it wasn't, it would be shoved up your ass just like the nuclear turtle shit. I am so fucking angry that even watching an Adam Sandler movie will make me happier than I am right now. If the Greeks made a god of stupidity, you would be the closest candidate to that fucking role. It's not a good thing when you're so fucking unintelligent that people like Socrates would get on their toga-wearing-ass knees to worship your dumb fucking ass. That's when you need to reconsider obviously pointless life choices. Read a fucking book for crying out loud, man! What the literal fuck is wrong with you? After this fiasco I will need at least 12 hours of building up sanity with my psychiatrist. After this she will need to prescribe Ritalin that I will have to take 5 times an hour just to prevent me from snapping because of your disgusting act of stupidity. Your post gave me type 5 syphilis, which I didn't even fucking know existed until I felt itchy dick. Thanks a fucking lot. That was sarcasm, by the way, if you're too stupid to understand what that is (you probably are). Is it even legal for someone to be enough of a dumbass to make someone experience these sorts of emotions? Witnessing your stupid shit was like crawling through the depths of Tarturus itself and Cleveland. I have no words to describe this unintelligible shit yet I have so many. Once more, a paradox caused by stupid turtle shit. I have the most uncomfortable urge to strangle you Edgar Allan Poe style, you evil-eyed, black cat piece of fuck. Put that on your fucking tombstone. For Pete's sake man, you have drained almost every last sane brain cell I have developed ever since my unplanned birth and made my life more unenjoyable than it has to be you fucking cholesterol-ridden shit. I already consider jumping in front of a steamroller whenever I look at my uglyass reflection in the mirror, and then you come along and do this stupid fucking shit. Making me think of turtle shit infused with uranium-235. I'll punch you so fucking fast the force of your damn teeth breaking will cause nuclear fusion to happen from all the damn kinetic energy and make you implode into your possibly nonexistent dick. You want to defy logic, I will too motherfucker. You're possibly the most ignorant piece of fuck I have had the unfortunate chance to stumble upon in the butthole of the internet. I hope that shittyass post was worth it because I am going to kick your shitposting ass if I ever cross paths with you. Eat nuclear turtle shit.

(I lived)\n\n-Edited for completeness and to answer questions-\nFirst, I have many chronic disease which exacerbated my condition, which was precipitated by a botched surgery at the SAME hospital I was in the MICU. Without getting into all the legalese, the hospital did everything in their power to keep me in their facility which is why I had to consult a lawyer to understand my right to go home to \"recover\". In fairness, I already had contacted the lawyer to draw up paperwork to update my advance directive/DNR, but I was given fairly low odds by the multitude of doctors and I really just wanted to go home to be with my family and die. The attorney facilitated my release but it was thwarted by multiple issues, one of which is the aforementioned aspiration during surgery causing me to spend longer in the hospital than anticipated. \n\nMy partial list of conditions include: systemic sclerosis (diffuse), pulmonary fibrosis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Raynaud's... the list is long and distinguished. As a result I have fibrosis and dysmotility of the esophagus and stomach, which is directly related to the reason for the aspiration into my lungs (and 8 years of not eating/TPN/enteral feeding). TPN necessitates a Hickman catheter which HAS to be replaced if it gets infected and is inevitable over the period of time I had such. I had one such routine surgery to replace my Hickman, but the facility neglected to put the safety clips on the dual lumen and when I got up to go to the bathroom at 2 AM half my blood was on the floor and in my bed. I was losing consciousness, went into respiratory arrest, had multiple strokes and was put into a coma for 4 days at THE SAME FACILITY that botched the routine surgery. While under their \"care\" I contracted MRSA 3x, double lung pneumonia 3x, intubated 3x, ventilator, nasal gastric tube and every machine you can imagine. I should also mention I lost use of my entire right side (I'm right handed) so all my communication was attempting to write with my left hand as I was intubated for most of the 3 months. I can't tell you how difficult it was to look into my children's eyes and to only be able to squeeze their hands and shed tears, thinking it would be my last form of communication with them...

And you are now Choking literally to death, or at least that is what it feels like.\n\nYes in Public this is a Horrible situation, its not much better at home, but the embarrassment factor is HUGE.  People think you are choking on something you just ate 9/10, but you aren't, and you really dont have time to explain this shit at the moment.\n\nThere is really no common denominator for this, it just happens...   However I personally notice that I tend to have the issue more often when I am stressed out, I may not even realize that I'm dealing with stress, but in hindsight often times when this happens to me more times than not, Stress seems to be the modifier.\n\nNow, let me take you on another fun little offset to this...  I am not a medical professional, I can only tell you to the best of my ability what I feel, and how it happens at least this is what I think happens.  \n\nI have no idea why there are moments when a simple bodily function of swallowing your saliva suddenly tries to kill you....  Here is what I do think it could be related to.  A condition called Laryngospasm.\n\nI'll drop a link, if you have had the Choking on my spit thing happen, I encourage you to at least give it a look.  Now with this being said there are degrees of this.  There is the Worst case EVER, and then there are the times you were able to catch it early, and prevent the severe version from happening.  However you do still cough some, but its short in duration and you recover much more quickly than you do in an all out episode.\n\nAs I said I am no medical professional, but I think a small amount of spit, kinda goes down wrong and sometimes triggers your Larynx to go into a spasm which in turn makes you literally not able to breath at all, and the natural reflex to this is to FREAK OUT!  So as you might have guessed when you FREAK OUT, the situation goes from bad to worse.\n\nI have found that if I place my hand, a napkin or anything in front of my mouth when this happens, I close my mouth and try to take tiny small breaths instead of GASPING for air, which is what you naturally want to do because your brain is saying HEY MAN I CANNOT FUCKING BREATH, I NEED SOME AIR AND I NEED IT RIGHT NOW....  Followed by OMG WE ARE DIEING!...\n\nI have had this happen to me for years, but in the past 5 years it seems to be happening more frequently.  As I said sometimes it is directly relative to stress, however not always.\n\nFor those who have dealt with this you probably already know, you go to the Ear Nose and Throat Doctor, or your Primary care doctor, you tell them the story and they look at you like you have lost your damn mind....  They have no answers, their is little to no information about this online.\n\nEXCEPT...  There is this one Doctor who just happen to have the same issue, and he just happened to be an ENT Doctor, and he has a video online and he explains what your feeling, how it happens and what is going on.  I was so glad when I found this guy and his video because I literally felt like I was the only person on the planet that had this issue.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPtdkqOLLP4\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/expert-answers/laryngospasm/faq-20058269", "score": 1, "author": "digitalsparks", "page_title": "Laryngospasm: Sudden, Terrifying Difficulty Breathing - YouTube"}, {"id": "ej1asup", "body": "Shit, I go into convulsions.

The man watches with kindling excitement as the treat spirals down the track towards his waiting hands. He reaches for it, feeling blessed to have received his favorite color. After a moments admiration of the shining orb, he pops it into his mouth and smiles with contentment. The gumball is crushed between his gnawing teeth, giving way in dessicated, flavorless fragments. He's taken aback by the the repellent texture and immediately spits it out. \"Dog shit\" he laments, cruelly ripped back to reality. \"I guess it always was\".", "score": 9, "author": "EpicSlothToes"}, {"id": "ffxqrj1", "body": "Sounds like a sweet deal to me.", "score": 28, "author": "Brodner"}, {"id": "ffy9f3j", "body": "Goes to show how much of a rip off they always were if they're still profitable.", "score": 7, "author": "Them_James"}, {"id": "ffykh80", "body": "I'd always see people and now coworkers doing fundraisers, always with a box or two of \"worlds greatest chocolate\" candy bars.  \n\nIt's always $1 and back then when you'd see them, most of the time people wouldn't buy them.
