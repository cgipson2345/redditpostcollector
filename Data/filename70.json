{"subreddit": "TransferStudents", "body": "Hello,\n\nI am currently a high school senior and I decided that I plan to transfer from a california CC in one year. I have already done a bunch of research, and know that it is very doable but I still would like to hear some advice and any answers to my questions!\n\nSo right now I will have finished 14 AP classes after the end of my senior year, which gives me a lot of UC transferable credits, and I only need 60! I've calculated my total to be around \\~55 credits? but I'm gonna say 45 in case I've miscalculated anything, the list is:\n\nAP Art History(3), AP Chemistry(3), AP Computer Science Principles(4), AP English Language and Composition(5), AP United States History(3), AP Psychology(5), AP World History(5), AP Environmental Science(4), AP Human Geography(4). And right now I am completing the exams for AP Macroeconomics, AP Calculus BC(hopefully a 5), AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP US Government, and AP Computer Science. Looking at all this, I should have at the very least 45-50 credits for UC transfer already!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm planning to major in Biology so I will need to complete the prerequisites for a transfer major in that which are 2 Biology courses, 2 General Chemistry Courses, and 1 or 2 Organic Chemistry courses with lab (it depends on the university for example UCI requires 2 and UCLA only requires 1) along with an English composition class.\n\nMy plan is to take in the Summer: General Chemistry A, English composition, (and maybe an upper-divison Math?)\n\nFall: General Chemistry B, Biology 1\n\nSpring: Organic Chemistry A, Biology 2\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. the TAG eligibility requirements say I need to \"Complete one UC transferable math course with a grade of C or better by the end of the summer 2022 term\u00a0for fall 2023 admission\". Does this mean that even if I get AP Calc BC credits to clear my math requirements that I will still have to take a Math course at a CC for TAG eligibility?\n2. UCs only accept transfers as long as they are not considered \"senior-level standing\" by having 20 credits of upper-division coursework. If I complete Organic Chemistry I will have 10 upper-division credits, and I may need to take an upper-division math(for TAG eligibility and because I did Calc BC) putting me at 14 upper-division credits. Does this put me in any danger or risk for admission?\n3. Since I am gonna enter CC with over 45 credits through AP scores do I get priority registration since I have more credits than everyone else?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I covered everything but if I missed anything or anyone has some advice please let me know!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 5/5/2023:\n\nJust looked at what everyone's said so far and have made some changes to my plan! Firstly, I am adding 2 Psychology courses so that, 1. I can fulfill TAG for UCI for guranteed admission (I can't TAG into bio for UCI because they require 2 semesters of Organic Chem for it), and 2. I plan on double majoring in Bio and Psych at other UCs. Luckily most of the prereqs for Bio and Psych overlap! Second thing is that I checked my required courses for major thoroughly and had to add a few things:\n\nHere is my new course plan, and I have already checked that all these classes are available at my CC! For Summer: General Chemistry A, English 101(2nd English prereq), Intro to Statistics (transfer requirement for Bio at all the UCs)\n\nFall: Bio 1, Human Physiology (required for UCLA), General Chemistry B, Psychobiology (prereq for psych)\n\nSpring: Bio 2, Organic Chemistry A, Social Psychology (preq for psych)\n\nMy course load is heavier but I'm not just taking 2 classes per semester anymore so it's pretty normal now! It seems like my biggest limiter is that transfer requirements for UCB and UCI require 2 semesters of Organic Chem, but if I want to transfer in a year it's impossible since I won't have a 4th semester to take Organic Chem B ;( , unless they offer it in Winter semester but I highly doubt it.\n\nSo with this new plan I complete ALL the transfer requirements for Bio at all UCs (except for UCB and UCI because of Organic Chem), and I also complete it for Psychology at all UCs. I'm not 100% if I want to double major in bio and psychology (I might major in only one of them) but I will have a lot more options available to me when I decide to transfer!\n\nThank you and let me know if anyone has extra advice or if I missed anything again!", "title": "One-year Transfer to a UC from community college?", "id": "1387mv5", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/1387mv5/oneyear_transfer_to_a_uc_from_community_college/", "permalink": "/r/TransferStudents/comments/1387mv5/oneyear_transfer_to_a_uc_from_community_college/", "author": "HistoricalAd5644", "comments": [{"id": "jiwz4e0", "body": " Im a little confused, Any course work you complete at a CC should be lower division and wouldn\u2019t affect your eligibility since they are two year institutions.", "score": 3, "author": "IvyOaks"}, {"id": "jix22xs", "body": "1.

This means 2 things:  1. You will have a disadvantage during admissions. 2. You will have to spend more time and money taking those classes at a UC after you transfer there. I would recommend you get most of those requirements done by the end of the fall when you are applying to maximize your chances of getting into a UC and take advantage of the affordability ID the CC system.\nAlso, I do not know if you have checked your CC's classes yet, but I do not think many schools offer General Chem 1 during the summer or winter. In that case, you would have to consider using your AP chem exam to waive the General Chem 1 requirement. But like other people have said, some schools may not accept your AP Chem credit, so it will get really complicated.\nI am a one year transfer as well (with less AP credit than yours), and I got into most of the schools I applied to, but that is because I am an Econ major. For STEM majors like Bio, it is really hard to transfer  in one year regardless of the amount of AP credit you have (mostly due to the physics series and organic Chem series). But after all, you can still apply this year and see if you can get into the school you want to attend, as long as you do not mind putting in the effort on your UC app.", "score": 1, "author": "rowlet1724"}, {"id": "jixp0bp", "body": "i\u2019m a bio major and got accepted to every UC, and i\u2019m going to berkeley now from cc. message me if u have any questions.

{"subreddit": "TransferStudents", "body": "hi everyone\n\n The \"third\" is in quotations because I'm behind a semester (my first-year spring semester was voided due to medical reasons). I also got really bad grades and failed classes both senior and (only 1) my first year due to the same medical issues (rare chronic illness, only got diagnosed and treated the summer after the first year when I almost died lolz). I did pretty well in high school (3.8 UW, 4.1-2 W gpa) and have been doing well so far since treatment (3.9 college gpa---excluding the first semester where I got a 2.2 or something). I really want to do computer hardware engineering so I would like to be an electrical engineering major with a computer science minor. \n\nI'm currently at SUNY UB rn but it is very far from my home. It's been an inconvenience as my treatment centers and specialists are near my home, I'm an unusual case of an already rare disease so it's near impossible to form a medical care network here. I applied and got admitted to SUNY SBU for the upcoming fall! This is a commutable distance from my home. The issue is that they didn't direct admit me into my major, my first bad semester played a part in that. And it's pretty much impossible for me to get into a computer science minor, especially without a declared major. I'll admit that I should have done more research and applied to more schools near me in NYC instead of just overfocusing on LI and underestimating how gatekept CEAS is at my new school. It is a bit disheartening that I won't be able to take computer science classes.\n\nShould I attempt to transfer again for fall 2024 so my course of study will be what I'd want or is it not worth the hassle/would be too late for me? I'm graduating a year late, so even though I'm a rising junior, I still have two years left after the end of my third year. I'm aware that other generally comparable engineering schools near me are also much more selective (like cooper union, nyu, etc). So, I don't find my situation a complete soul-crusher because the chances of me getting somewhere more ideal and close-by isn't very high given the duper low acceptance rates. Worst case scenario, I'll self-study for now and do grad school in computer engineering. I'm fine with either option of transfer apps round 2 or saving the effort for grad school; which is why I'm having a hard time deciding.....\n\ndo lmk how grad school app's / industry stuff in my field would be like or if there's some hidden accreditated school near me which is on par with my current one that i should consider or if u need more info :3\n\n\\[extra background on my initial decisions: I choose to go far initially because I thought my medical issues were a somatic psychiatric thing as the medical doctors didn't have an answer and bc my parents were extremely hostile. I tried to get professional mental help but all the meetings were on Zoom due to the covid lockdown at the time, and my parents didn't give me privacy during my therapist appointments so I felt like I just had to get away. They're nicer now tho because they feel guilty since I actually did have a medical problem lol. I also didn't step down to a CC and then step up after my bad medical year because I already finished a lot of gen ed's/prereq's due to AP credits and getting B's my first semester---it was all B's and one F rip. I'm not going to stay close to home forever due to my medical condition but will have to for the next few years because still experimenting with which meds work best and just other watch-and-wait formalities to see if I'm getting stable.\\]", "title": "Debating on attempting to transfer a second time after starting my \"third\" year, would like insights and feedback on my situation pls", "id": "1385us7", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/1385us7/debating_on_attempting_to_transfer_a_second_time/", "permalink": "/r/TransferStudents/comments/1385us7/debating_on_attempting_to_transfer_a_second_time/", "author": "meow-meowmeowmeow", "comments": [{"id": "jiwrzmq", "body": "As someone who\u2019s transferring for a second time and has had health issues (been hospitalized/seen for chronic pancreatitis issues as well as mental health issues) I think staying at the university you transferred to would be the best option, IF you are able to study what you want to.

People put a lot of weight on the name of a school, when in reality, it\u2019s the degree that matters most.

Usually they also post it online. Your best bet is to go over every minute detail and try to maximize your points in that system. Some do points for medical experience or extensive volunteer hours or being bilingual or attending specific CCs. For many of the programs you can search annual admissions threads on allnurses.com by school name and get an idea of what previous cycles looked like in terms of expectations and timing and cutoffs. I haven\u2019t seen any of that for CSUF though. I\u2019d try talking to their nursing school admissions people by email and/or in person and trying to gather that information. See if you can find a current student who went to your CC (maybe on LinkedIn?) and ask questions. \n\nYou probably should also look at other nearby nursing programs, like CSUDH. \n\nA lot of people end up either doing ADN (or even LVN) programs at CCs and then transitioning to a BSN. Others graduate with a different undergrad degree and then apply for (second bachelor\u2019s) accelerated BSN or entry level MSN. You can find quite a few public and private programs like that around LA - I\u2019ve heard good things about CSULA, UCLA, CSUCI and USF Orange County. It\u2019s also a good idea to look into programs in other states because it\u2019s just so competitive in California. I remember seeing some allnurses discussions with people who could not get into a California school (not even/especially CC RN programs) but were accepted to John\u2019s Hopkins and Columbia and Emory for post bac nursing programs. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to identify early which schools have admissions systems that might fit your strengths and focus on becoming exactly what they look for. \n\nYou are really smart to be researching this now. You can build the right profile and study for the TEAS or other nursing exams you might need. I would also suggest you get certified as a CNA or MA and work for a bit in a healthcare setting so you are certain nursing is right for you. Over half my daughter\u2019s CNA class decided to look into different careers after getting some practical experience. Best to be sure before you put too much time into it. And it\u2019ll boost your application at a lot of schools.", "score": 2, "author": "RetiringTigerMom"}]}

Just to keep it brief, I mentioned my grandfather's death during Covid, Covid travel ban affecting my dad who went overseas to take care of my grandfather, and my terrible mental health last year (will leave it at that because that period, while short, is still terrifying for me because of the thoughts I had).

However, I have run into a fatal issue on behalf of the CC that has crucially jeopardized my admission into each one of these universities. On March 29, this spring semester, I woke up to an email stating that all my spring courses had been dropped because I failed to verify my identity; this is something that I had never received an email or a phone call about prior. I immediately contacted the school to remedy the situation, where I was met with apologies and told that my classes would be reinstated immediately. I took fast action on this matter because my stats course was supposed to start the following week, which was an absolutely critical piece in my ability to transfer. Rather, it took over a week to reinstate my courses, meaning that I was placed on the waitlist for stats and someone had taken my spot while I was \"dropped\", even though I was completely enrolled prior. I was told the course was full and that it was the end of the matter- that it was an unfortunate issue. \n\nFast forward to today: I have gotten into all three of my absolute dream schools- something that I have worked tirelessly for my entire life. Yet I am now being told that I am unable to meet the transfer requirements because I failed to maintain my spot in my stats course due to a mistake on behalf of the college.

They'll likely release the 2023-24 transfer by major data around feb 2024. \n\nIn my opinion, you need some crazy good ECs and 4.0 GPA if you want to stand a chance, especially if not tap certified.

So yes it is definitely possible. \n\nThe UCs clearly state that if you reapply they won\u2019t look at any old freshman applications but they will look at all previous transfer applications.\n\nTBH a lot of transfer admission is just a numbers game. CSUs admit mostly based on GPA with points for local status and a few other things especially for the most competitive campuses/majors (like prep classes for nursing or SJSU CS). I don\u2019t think they evaluate beyond that so I wouldn\u2019t worry. \n\nEven among the UCs only LA/SD/I/B read the PIQs for admissions for all majors. The others work more like TAG and go off grades and prerequisites completed. They all read that optional section to explain issues so be sure you let them know there if you got sick this term or weren\u2019t able to enroll in the class or something like that. \n\nI think by fixing whatever went wrong with your application you can have an excellent chance of getting back into the schools you most want.\n\nEdit: just saw your CC didn\u2019t offer a class you listed as planned?

Many were also taking close to a full time class load. A couple of classes is doable but over 12 hours can be a lot of work. It\u2019s hard, and fairly often a very capable student will need to settle for a C on an exam they would have aced if a work emergency hadn\u2019t eliminated study time. If you aren\u2019t going to grad school grades don\u2019t matter that much anyway so I understand their priorities. I worry about the active parents who are full time school and work - the burnout/lack of sleep is sometimes obvious and I actually had one exceptional single mom experience a complete mental breakdown close to graduation which was so heartbreaking to watch. When you are juggling too much and something somewhere goes wrong it affects everything because your time and resources are stretched so thin. So be careful. \n\nThat said I think the CSU is set up for working students with lots of online, evening, summer and even weekend classes. Right or wrong, faculty know our students are busy and we kind of drop our class expectations to what the majority of students can handle with a busy life outside. It\u2019s built for working students. The CSU mission is to teach and serve students and develop California\u2019s workforce and I think we do that pretty well. Upper division classes are generally small and taught/graded directly by faculty. Research is expected but teaching is the most important part of the job of a professor. We really get to know many of our students well. \n\nThe UC mission is research to develop new opportunities and understanding and faculty must focus on grants and publications with teaching being much less a key part of the job. UC faculty generally teach one (often large) class (with the help of TAs and discussion sections) vs the 3 for a CSU professor. The system is really built to support research more than working students. When my daughter started at UCLA I was shocked because there were so very few evening classes. It became pretty clear watching my kids navigate the UC that class times and course expectations were built on the assumption that for students school would be the priority. They just aren\u2019t generally already in demanding jobs, but that doesn\u2019t mean they only go to school. It\u2019s pretty common for UC students to work part-time 10-15 hours a week in internships and/or volunteer at hospitals or work in a research lab or whatever will help them move forward with their career. I think by the end my oldest daughter (social sciences student) had obligations that took about 40 hours a week outside school with all her activities. She chose her electives based on what time they were offered, not how useful they would be. At that point her classes weren\u2019t that hard for her but she was sleeping like 5 hours a night and drinking a lot of coffee and had a mini meltdown of her own. My younger one (STEM major) took a full load of 20 hours her last term and could barely work 6 hours a week and also struggled with her mental health because her courses required so much work and she had to catch up after health issues. Her program had mandatory night classes and morning classes too, not to help students but because that worked for the instructors. Remember that wherever you go it can be tough getting a schedule that lets you work during normal business hours the last term or two because you are on those final capstone courses with just a couple of class times to choose from. \n\nPlease don\u2019t sacrifice your mental health trying to juggle a demanding job with school. Pick a program where you think you can have a good balance of what you want. Maybe talk to current students or read school subreddits.

I know it\u2019s a bit different for the engineering school, but for me it\u2019s almost a waste not to double major at UCLA. I always planned on doing it regardless of where I went but after roughly planning my classes for my \u201cmain major\u201d I still had 32 units to meet the graduation requirements. So my second major fit perfectly into that 32 units with an even spread over the two years(three classes a term) but even an extra class or two may not be killer for someone that needs them. So if you attend UCLA is that something obtainable for your major and interests? That way you could do best of both worlds. \n\n\nOn the flip side given they are the same cost and both have programs you\u2019re interested in, what location do you like better? If Cal Poly didn\u2019t end up being 12-9k out of pocket even with my aid and fed loans I think I would be committing. Location is amazing, the campus is nice, transfers pretty much have a guaranteed single room(shared on campus apt but individual rooms), and SLO is just such a great city! More walkability, more unique shops and restaurants/food places, and the weather is soooo much nicer compare to LA in general. \n\n\nNot to say UCLA is not a pretty campus but it\u2019s a different vibe for sure. As far as grad school goes an insider secret I\u2019ve become aware of (which may not even be a secret at all??) is that if you have an advisor lined up they can tell admissions to admit you and they do! So going to UCLA may have that benefit if you make a connection with a professor that also can be a grad advisor. (This may only apply for MS that are project based, my engineering friend had the option to do a capstone project under an advisor instead for their masters but went the class route). But if you went to Cal Poly that doesn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t reach out to grad professors at UCLA and still get an in by expressing interest in a capstone project under them. \n\n\nOverall I\u2019d still pick SLO because its still a highly regarded school and though it isn\u2019t a national ranked school(lacks PhDs) it\u2019s I believe #1 for its category.

{"subreddit": "TransferStudents", "body": "So I have a tough choice to make between going to UCSD or UCLA as a Biology major. Due to my circumstances, I don't have to worry about housing at all when attending UCSD, while I would have to pay around 20k-34k extra in the 2 years I attend UCLA because of housing. However, I do feel like moving to LA gets me more out of my comfort zone and gets me to be more independent (which I want!) vs being in SD (since it would be nice to be away from family!)\n\nRationally, I feel like UCSD is probably the better choice in this scenario when considering the money saved and major (UCSD's bio program is really good, but tbh I can't go wrong here), and the fact UCSD and UCLA are both pretty good schools in their own right. I have visited both campuses, and while I think UCLA's is a little cooler, UCSD is still pretty cool too, so that didn't really push me one way or the other...\n\nI checked my commute to both based on where I probably will be at, and UCSD would probably be about a 50-minute to an hour commute (add 20 minutes with traffic; I don't mind the length) from where I would be staying vs UCLA being around a 20-minute walk. But, I don't think that time saved ends up paying off how much extra I would be paying (also not considering utilities and roommates). \n\nI'm also not sure if the college experience ends up being a big factor either because I would be working if I went to UCLA to pay for rent, so I am unsure if I actually would get that \"college experience\" that UCLA offers. I'm just wondering if there is something else I am not considering in my choice between UCSD vs UCLA? \n\nIt is a little ironic because I have always wanted to go to UCLA, but it feels like I have a really good choice here.

This may vary from institution to institutions so you should check with the university that you want to go to specifically.\n\n>would I have a big benefit in having gotten into those institutions before when I reapply as a transfer student (does anyone have specific experience with this situation?)?\n\nI think usually no.

I think this is another thing that depends on the specific university though.\n\n>what are the pros and cons of transferring after your first year or after your second year as a transfer student?\n\nWell if you transfer after your first year you would be a sophomore level transfer but if you do 2 years then it'd be a junior level transfer. If you do 2 years you'd complete more classes and only need to do an additional 2 years at the university as opposed to 3 (if you transfer after 1 year) and you would therefor save more money. Also if you transfer after 2 years you will likely finish almost all your general education before transferring to university so you won't pay that high tuition just to take a simple English class.\n\nThis is another thing you should check with the specific college you want to transfer to because some universities only take transfers at the Junior level and don't take Sophomore level transfers.\n\n>additionally, what would you recommend I do to ensure the highest chances of getting into these well-ranked colleges again especially for STEM/engineering pathways?\n\nEach University have different requirements for what you need to complete in order to transfer. Figure out what the requirements are for your major, and schedule your classes based on that. Make sure to do really well (try to get all or mostly A's) in the classes that are required for your major. \n\nIf you're going to a community college in California and you're thinking of transferring to a UC or CSU, then you can use [assist.org](https://assist.org) to see which classes are required for each major at your specific community college for that major at the University you want to transfer to.", "score": 1, "author": "Suicyclone"}]}

I just thought, \"maybe it would be nice to go here,\" so I just decided to apply to the top 3 schools I wanted to go to that roasted me with rejections 2 years ago. Even with good metrics, i should've expected high odds of getting in, but I still cried at both my UCI and UCLA acceptances.\n\nI deal with mild-moderate anxiety, of which can completely screw me up mentally at times. At its peak I don't sleep for multiple days and am constantly worried about being able to fall asleep (in case anyone is wondering, I don't do drugs and I rarely drink). I had an especially bad anxiety attack in the fall of 2022.

Since then I've just been hoping to get out of here so I can be closer to home and hopefully be in a place where I fit in better.  To be honest though, Davis has been better since the end of fall and I really decided to try and enjoy college rather than catastrophizing all the cons of being here.\n\nI decided I'm probably going to commit to UCI because not only am I close enough to commute, but because I'll be more comfortable basically at home, I can feel safer in a familiar place and be able to continue schooling with less anxiety for a while.

She is probably amazing but just not lucky this time. I\u2019m sure she is disappointed but should not be surprised. \n\nThere are a lot of routes into nursing and it doesn\u2019t matter whether you learn your RN certification skills in an associate\u2019s degree program at a CC, as part of a BSN at a CSU or as a master\u2019s degree at John\u2019s Hopkins, the pay and opportunities are the same and they are excellent. If she completed all those prerequisites she should consider alternative routes into the field. She is halfway there already. \n\nThe ADN programs at CCs are cheap and thus very popular and hard to get into (honestly some are maybe harder than Columbia for a good student) but she should see what\u2019s around her. There is also the option to do an LVN and then have your employer pay to cover the bridge programs to continue on and earn a RN and eventually BSN. I actually think it might be a little easier to get accepted for those bridge programs than a straight RN but don\u2019t know for sure.\n\nHer local CSU and CSULB offer probably the best admissions chances for a BSN in a California public school because most CSUs add points for being local (LB does not). I think acceptance rates for those are about 10% and you can learn a lot about the cutoffs by reading the allnurses.com discussion threads for each school. \n\nUSD, USF and Samuel Merritt are California privates that are pretty well regarded. I bet some smaller schools like Dominican are good too. \n\nA lot of people choose to go out of state. Boise State attracts a good crew for some reason and I have heard Joyce University in SLC (which will accept most applicants and let you start fairly quickly) has solid training. \n\nMany people opt to transfer and graduate in another major like psychology or public health and then apply for either accelerated (second bachelor\u2019s) BSN programs or entry-level master\u2019s programs. These tend to be a bit more expensive and appropriately a little easier to get into since they cost more and require a previous degree. Several CSUs have them. So does U Penn and if she in range for UCLA she might have a shot there or at Emory which is actually not unreasonable to pay for if you can come back and earn a California nursing salary. \n\nBoth UCI and UCLA offer entry level master\u2019s programs, as does Davis. It\u2019s a little hard to tell exactly but I think the acceptance rates for those are around 25% (they combine acceptance rates for all nursing grad programs in the US News info). Many people apply, make the wait list, ask the admissions staff how they could improve their application, and then try again with better essays + more experience and get in the second or third try. I would suggest that even though she is discouraged she see if the nursing school admissions folks would look at her application and let her know how she could improve if she wants to try for the UCLA MECN (a class of 70) or UCI MEPN (I think class of 40?) programs. That information might help her apply to other programs and the UCs. \n\nShe could of course re-apply next year as a transfer but her odds are better applying for those master\u2019s programs (25% vs 1%). I couldn\u2019t tell for sure but it looks to me like the admissions rates for specialized (NP type) grad nursing degrees from UCLA must be pretty high, like maybe even 50%. So even if she opts to do a very different kind of nursing program to get started in the field as an RN, she can still earn a UCLA nursing degree someday. Or maybe just work in a UC hospital once she is certified with her RN. They hire good nurses from all kinds of backgrounds, not just the UC nursing programs. \n\nIt\u2019s so competitive to get into any nursing program in California she should just pick one that her strengths will work for. \n\nBut she probably knows most of this.

I received a full ride, their presidential scholarship and tuition, housing, etc was covered.

I left the school and have not returned since. \n\nI also had two hearings for both of the suspensions about 3 weeks following but I did not attend as I wasn\u2019t interested in reliving the situation or what was going to be said or brought up. Although I did not officially fill out and paperwork to withdraw, I did try to call as well as email the registrar department to let them know I want to withdraw.\n\nAbout a month ago, I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe the school about 13K. I called the financial aid department because I don\u2019t know why I would be charged anything considering the school gave me a full ride and even if they took it away it\u2019s not like I would be returning. So when I called they told me it was actually about 9.4 K (more unorganized communication as usual). regardless, I owe the school money according to them for a semester I was never there for. This is because I never filled out that withdrawal form although i thought I had made it quite clear with my email in addition to never attending the school again or the hearings. \n\nThey\u2019re hard to get in contact with as it is and the problem now is I am trying to apply to another school in my state (yes this school was also out of state for me) but they have holds on my account preventing me from getting my transcript because of the balance I owe.

I asked an admissions advisor about this because I hadn't completed a second course in English composition, but when I had brought up this issue to UC Irvine's advisor they stated *\"If you are an intercampus transfer, you automatically satisfy the 7 course pattern , which includes the UC-E and UC-M.\"* Meaning that if you are already a UC student, you will not have to complete any of the specific courses it states.  \n\n\n**HOWEVER (two points)**:  \n1. UC to UC transfer requires something else. You'll need your academic advisor to fill what is called a \"**Letter of Reciprocity.**\" This basically tells your new UC that you have completed all your GE credits that you needed to complete at the UCSB (in your case). I go to Davis, so there's a simple website I can go to that lists all the documents I need, but UCSB (idk).  \n2. Regardless of what you do, you'll need to finish the course work that is a required prerequsitie to admissions. At UCI they called these courses \"Conditioned for Admissions\" meaning that if you don't finish the courses you told the UCs you would do in either the TAU or the original application **AND** they are marked as prerequisites for the major you picked, your acceptance will **Likely** be recisinded.

I've already got some results so i'm not too stressed, and i'm writing this post just out of curiosity just as a prediction to look back on to know if the astrology actually works.\n\nThis post is supposed to be a summary of what I've found so far reading through reddit and collegeconfidential about the whole astrology/prediction thing. Here is what i've observed so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The astrology has been confirmed to have a high chance of working(except the FTT/FFT part), check the CC thread on \"UC Berkeley Portal Astrology Discussion 2023\"\n2. FFT/FTT/etc do not apply to our current transfer application cycle. I've only seen FFT so far out of like 50+ people i've seen mention it today and yesterday, so I believe it has been patched.\n3. Not Authorized/Forbidden and the ID showing on the campus website should be correlated to whether an account has been made on berkeley's systems. With my hobbyist background in the web, not authorized means that you don't have a valid account to login to their servers, and as a result see anything on their system. Forbidden means that you don't have permission to see the content on the page. Keep in mind, there are people who have had not authorized switch to forbidden, so just because its not forbidden doesn't mea you didn't get in. Forbidden should be better than not authorizided. TLDR prediction: Forbidden heavily indicates admission/waitlist\n4. California Residence for Tuition Purposes Email - Not everyone that has been accepted or waitlisted may recieve this email, so if you didn't get it I don't think it means much. Especially if you are international or out of state, i don't know if you've been sent this email. But i think that if you do get it, it should be treated as support in case other signals say that you got in. People have said they have called ppl at Berkeley and they said it isn't indicative of admission, however admissions cannot admit that it is an indicator of admission. It would just go viral and everyone would know whether they got in or not. They might as well just release the decisions right now since if they revealed that the letter indicates admission, then it would mean the same thing except in a more boring way.  Also, the email has been confirmed to be a mistake (sent out a week early) when another redditor called them. TLDR prediction: Indicates admission/waitlist if you have forbidden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings we can't explain\n\n1. Some people have received the email and have not authorized on their account\n2. Whether you have been waitlisted or admitted based on the evidence above. Logically i think that if you got the email, you should be admitted, but that's just speculation (forbidden+email = accept, forbidden+no email = waitlist? or out of state/international admit/waitlist?)\n3. A lot of people seem to have gotten the forbidden/email. Considering berkeley's low acceptance rate, i'd guess that only like 30% of people actually get forbidden but i'm seeing around 50-60%. Maybe its just a bias where only the people that got the email go on here and ask, but maybe it does mean nothing after all.\n\nIf we take a logical standpoint on what this all means (keep in mind this is all entirely speculation)\n\n1. If you got into the school, they would have made you an account so that you can log in and see your tuition and other financial data. You may have an account if you have been waitlisted, nobody knows for sure though.\n2. If you got the email, that means they're going through your profile and calculating the tuition for you. In the email, it also suggests that you are able to check your account, meaning that you should have an account when the email should have been sent (next week).\" When registration fees first appear on student billing accounts, your account will reflect California resident fees. All students should be aware that payment is due by August 18, 2023. For more information about billing and payment at UC Berkeley, please refer to [http://studentbilling.berkeley.edu](http://studentbilling.berkeley.edu/) \"\n\nIf we had some statistics about the results of everyone here then maybe we can figure out what the combinations mean but i'm not that into it haha.

See part IV #5. https://scl.cornell.edu/residential-life/housing/housing-details/rates-amenities-licenses/academic-year-housing-license-2023-2024\n\nMy freshman roommate had a traumatic experience and her mom (who lived 6 hours away) wanted to come stay in our student on-campus apartment for 2 weeks to help out. That did not happen because 1) there just was no space for her to sleep there 2) all roommates, while sympathetic, were very unhappy at the prospect of a parent as a guest for more than just a weekend and 3) housing had very firm rules against parents (or any guests) staying in student housing. You might be able to have a friend or similar age sibling for a night or two especially if your roommate leaves for the weekend. Parents for the first month is just not going to be allowed. \n\nUnless you are in family housing intended for grad students your living situation is not going to be appropriate for guests. Most freshman share a small bedroom with 1-2 other same gender freshmen and frequently share other living spaces like showers, lounges and hallways with other students. Your roommate is not going to just be chill about sleeping in the same room with your mom and dad. Their parents (who will move their kids in and go sleep elsewhere) are going to complain to the housing department because that is definitely against the rules. The resident assistants in charge of the hall (assuming you are in a normal dorm) will definitely notice a pair of much older people wandering the halls and so will everyone else, and your parents will be ordered to leave. You yourself will get in trouble too and may be asked to move out while still being expected to pay your dorm fees. \n\nBest to nip this plan in the bud and come up with a different one right now. We recently helped my daughter (a grad student) move into a grad apartment in a building where students with families are allowed. She has her own room and bath and kitchen/living room shared with 1 university assigned roommate. We still stayed at a hotel to be courteous to her roommate. They have now reached a comfort level where both are ok with the other having a guest visit for up to a week but I think guests over 2 weeks would not be allowed even under the more relaxed rules for this type of housing. Guests for 2 weeks might be possible if you were in a studio apartment living alone but those are highly coveted and generally never given to freshmen. \n\nI suggest you have your parents talk to these folks. https://families.cornell.edu/ Or maybe contact them yourself and ask for help explaining how things work to your parents. I bet they can even set them up with some mentor parents from a similar area or culture that will explain this stuff. (Most colleges have \u201cclubs\u201d and activities to involve parents in positive ways like helping families of freshmen with expectations) These folks can also provide advice on places they could temporarily stay or housing options that might allow them - you could legally live together in a rented off campus house or apartment and possibly if they have space the school might let you live together in the family campus housing meant for older married students with kids. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the housing and family support staff will all urge your parents to have you stay in the normal dorms and learn and grow from a normal freshman experience, BTW. That was definitely a big emphasis of the family information and support programs at my kids\u2019 colleges, and they really worked to gracefully disengage the helicopter parents starting at summer orientation. \n\nMaybe you could watch a movie that has images of dorm life to help your parents see what it\u2019s like and why it would never work? Unfortunately most of those also have storylines about sex and drinking and drugs which actually do not have to be a big part of college life if that\u2019s not what you want.", "score": 4, "author": "RetiringTigerMom", "page_title": "Academic Year Housing License 2023-2024 | Student & Campus Life | Cornell University"}]}

{"subreddit": "TransferStudents", "body": "So in 2020 when I graduated and was meant to apply for colleges, I kind of did not know what I wanted in life so I just went with a safe option that seemed good to me. I applied to only one school and despite having an alright GPA and SAT score (3.6 and 1250) I still got rejected. So I just went to community college and planned to transfer to that school (UCF) later on.\n\nFast forward 3 years and an ADHD diagnosis later I realized that I was only going to do good in my studies and career if I really cared and was interested in what I wanted to do. So I decided to pursue my dream of going to a semi-nice, urban, cold-state university with lots of lucrative employment opportunities nearby and getting a degree in computer science there.\n\nThe problem is my GPA is absolutely horrible, I have a 2.66 and I only have 2 semesters left until I graduate from the CC I am in. I am planning on retaking some old failed classes next semester, and this semester I was able to get help for my ADHD and am actually doing very well studies-wise. The highest GPA I could have at the time of transfer would be a 3.2 with the most effort possible. I'm mainly thinking of applying to Syracuse University but I'm going to be applying to many different ones that I like to hopefully have higher chances of getting into one. I know the acceptance rates for transfer students are absolutely abysmal, but if I were to get my GPA as high as possible (3.2), join as many computer science related organizations in my community college as I could, and write a jaw-dropping application essay about overcoming mental obstacles to find my passion (computer science) with proof of improvement (better grades and involvement in orgs) do you guys think I'd have a chance at getting into a good out of state college?", "title": "I may have messed up so bad that I will never get what I want but I still want to try, need some advice.", "id": "12r5dqv", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/12r5dqv/i_may_have_messed_up_so_bad_that_i_will_never_get/", "permalink": "/r/TransferStudents/comments/12r5dqv/i_may_have_messed_up_so_bad_that_i_will_never_get/", "author": "TuckMyFypo", "comments": [{"id": "jgtresm", "body": "Honestly, you won\u2019t get into Syracuse with a 3.2GPA for Computer Science (heavily impacted) regardless of a compelling story. \n\nI don\u2019t know the details of your case but you have a few options. \n\n1. Apply for an EW for courses taken after the fact. Most community colleges allow students to apply for EWs after the semester is over. This will remove the grade from your transcripts and will be replaced with an EW (it will not factor into your GPA). \n\nThe appeal process will require documentation. I recommended you do these 2 things: \n\nA. Get registered with your community colleges disability support programs and services department as a disabled student, adhd will more than likely qualify you \n\nB. Get an affidavit from your mental health care provider stating your untreated ADHD affected your ability to perform academically \n\nMost schools have a limit on how many days after a term is completed you can apply for an EW. In the event you\u2019ve passed this limit apply anyways. They will more than likely deny you. You can more than likely appeal this denial and it will be forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs office. You\u2019ll essentially need to explain how because of you\u2019re circumstances you weren\u2019t aware that an EW application after a term ended was even possible, talk about how performing poorly academically in conjunction with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD stressed you out. Mention how you wish you would\u2019ve known this was a thing. They\u2019ll maybe approve the appeal. Also mention your affidavit and how you\u2019re registered with the disabled student services and programs department \n\n2. You can more than likely retake courses you have either failed or received a D in. Retaking these courses will erase the F or D from affecting your GPA and your new grade will now impact GPA. This option is good if you can\u2019t get an EW but isn\u2019t as good as an EW.\n\n3. You can apply for academic renewal which is probably the easiest option here. The only problem is it will disregard an entire semesters worth of work. \n\nPersonal story: \n\nWhen i began community college I dropped out twice. I got an entire semester with Ws and one semester with Ws and one F. \n\nI came back, retook all the Ws and F. I even later went through the entire EW process mentioned above and was approved. Even successfully appealed to the vice presidents office. \n\nI finished my general education and was accepted to Columbia University in NYC. I worked really hard. It\u2019s never too late to make change but sometimes the change isn\u2019t pretty.\n\nPlease find yourself a point person at your campus. Someone who knows the bureaucratic systems in place there. Also, never take no for an answer. There is always a way even if the way isn\u2019t easy or conventional. \n\nTrust me, if you knew how many times someone at my community college told me I wouldn\u2019t be able to do something (not just getting into the Ivy League but successfully navigating and convincing vice presidents or financial aid department to do something) you\u2019d be surprised. \n\nGood luck, work hard, believe in yourself.

At both schools you can switch majors but probably not into CS. \n\nMy daughter always wanted UCI but went to Berkeley because with Covid it made sense to be close to home. The level of education was basically grad school in many respects. In fact many of her junior/senior courses were with grad students and if you were chosen to stay an extra year you could have a master\u2019s. Undergrads were able to teach as TAs and readers in small \u201cDeCal\u201d classes but also big ones like intro to data science. The faculty were phenomenal researchers but hit or miss on teaching ability so Berkeley students had to be very smart and just figure things out for themselves. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s cutthroat but because Cal chooses the very top students in terms of academics and extracurriculars everyone is driven to achieve. There\u2019s so much pressure to be doing internships and clubs and volunteering and research and strong competition for every cool opportunity on campus. Nobody hands you anything; you have to find and fight for what you want and are stronger for that. Exams in STEM classes tend to be hard with super low means so it\u2019s hard to get too cocky. You aren\u2019t really supposed to just sit and watch TV on a weeknight and feel ok about yourself; that takes some strength of character. The campus damn gorgeous with that view of the Bay but the number of crime warning emails gets disconcerting and my daughter had some unhappy experiences being chased by unstable homeless people. The Irvine campus is bigger and more spread out and has that gorgeous beach so close. Plus the weather is much balmier. I was surprised when my daughter got out the heavy gloves and scarves to wear around Cal even in March but when we visited I saw how much you\u2019d need them, especially in the mornings and evenings. In the end she liked being closer to home and misses that now she is in grad school down south. I know most young adults can\u2019t wait to be independent but think about whether having a place to escape your dorm or family who will help with laundry and groceries when you are sick or have finals could be a plus.

This can be hard to accept on a \"subconscious\" level or whatever because the first 18 years of our lives are basically just us preparing to get into a good college.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that a lot of colleges are getting tons and tons of applicants who are all overqualified when they have a limited number of seats. \n\nSo if the school has 200 available spots, but they have 1500 applicants half of which are overqualified, then they just have to narrow it down somehow.

Before I started college I was accepted to UCI, but I had to give up on my acceptance because of personal family issues. At the time, I felt pressured and lost about what direction I wanted to go in and ended up choosing a private college close to home. Despite the great people I met there, if I had a choice to do it over again I would go to a community college because tuition is expensive (my dad didn't let me know about our finances, but encouraged me to go anyway. If only I had thought more clearly at the time...) and I still held onto my dream of going to UCI I want to transfer to a UC now that time has passed and I'm ready (I have UCI in mind, but UCLA and UCB are good too! Ah, but they have lower acceptance rates I think..? and I also need to consider what's good for my major).\n\nI just recently found out however, that UCs prioritize transfers from community colleges. I did some research and also read that GPA doesn't transfer if it's from private to public (correct me if the info I found is wrong). UC college applications are due in the fall for the fall quarter of next year, from what I know, and I'm unsure about UC college apps for winter transfer.\n\nSo, if I transferred to a CC for fall 2023, is it true that my GPA won't transfer? How would that look on college apps? Should I take some courses over the summer at the CC to have a GPA (if that's how it works)? Should I just stay at the private college I'm at and try to directly transfer from there?\n\nPlease let me know if any of the information I have is wrong and if there's a better subreddit to post my question in. I know that there is a TAG program, but I don't think it will let me transfer with the majors I have in mind (I am considering computer science, software engineering, business information management, or something related. I will look into it more). I'll also be looking to get in contact with someone from the CC I'm looking at to help me with credits and planning.

{"subreddit": "TransferStudents", "body": "I could use some advice about Private (Canisius) vs. Public (Oswego) colleges. If anyone has someone insight into my questions, or even just general advice (never know what I could have overlooked) that would be awsome. I have questions and some background down bellow.\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that my end goal is to go to grad school and research Animal Behavior and/or Conservation.\n\nQuestions:\n\nThe big one: Would Canisius be worth going into debt(<$5k) for vs. still having quite a bit saved up after Oswego?\n\nWould Canisius have better/more available research opportunities?\n\nIs it going to be hard to get research experience at either college? (I heard it is a bit harder to get into opportunities than at community college)\n\nIs the quality of college and/or opportunities really any different? \n\nHow do I find what kinds of research is being done at the colleges? (Their websites haven't been very helpful, especially Oswego)\n\nHow important is quality/variety of housing/food?\n\nOn vs. Off campus? (Mainly asking for Oswego)\n\nSuppose grad school didn't work out after undergrad, would that change which college would have been better to go to? (Minor question)\n\nWhat about summer opportunities?\n\nIs there a better \"college experience\" at one or the other?\n\nWould one over the other help me getting into grad school more?\n\nWhat else does it seem like I'm missing or not considering?\n\nSome background:\nI'm graduating from community college this semester and I have a couple weeks to choose between the Animal Behavior, Ecology and Conservation B.S. at Canisius College or Zoology B.S. at SUNY Oswego.\n\n I have my financials (tuition/fees, housing, food, and transportation) worked out where I would be <$5k in debt (at worst, still broke but no debt at best) at Canisius (I have been working and saved up quite bit). If I went to Oswego I'm not sure how much it would cost bc I would be relying on the Excelsior Scholarship (I would have over $10k left if I got it, ~$5k left if I don't), but I'm iffy about it bc the application isn't even open yet and I've had problems with NY State financial aid being restrictive in the past. Plus I would be required to stay in NY for 2 years after graduating if I got the Excelsior Scholarship.\n\nI would be living off campus for both if them. At Canisius I already know where I would stay, but would have to find a place at Oswego.\n\nMy end goal is to go to grad school and study Animal Behavior, so Canisius is more along the lines of the type of classes I want for my main goal. Oswego has interesting classes as well, but they're more the type of classes that would be helpful for my backup plan if grad school doesn't work out.\n\nThe big thing I have been told to focus on is what research is being done at the colleges and go for what I'm more interested in, but I can't even find what's being done at Oswego (maybe I'm not looking in the right place?). The research at Canisius is right up my alley, with students researching the behavior and cognition of various animals. \n\nI have been told that research experience is very important for grad school applications, so I'm mostly concerned with what kind of experience I can get. I did do 2 research projects/internships at the community college, but I'm concerned if I will have a hard time getting into research since I'll be 2 years behind other student in networking wolith professors.\n\nA con for Canisius is that it would be harder for me to get some free time in nature to unwind compared to Oswego. It is somewhat appealing to see what it would be like to go to a big college, but it's not like I would have money to enjoy loving in a city anyways. \n\nEven while I'm writing this, Canisius is seeming more and more like the way to go, but I would appreciate any opinions on the matter.", "title": "Canisius vs. SUNY Oswego for Undergrad?", "id": "12j9y2p", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/12j9y2p/canisius_vs_suny_oswego_for_undergrad/", "permalink": "/r/TransferStudents/comments/12j9y2p/canisius_vs_suny_oswego_for_undergrad/", "author": "Shox_Sicarii", "comments": [{"id": "jg5y7fq", "body": "It's more efficient to get school-specific advice on their own subreddits and FB groups. But in general, I would weigh the cost (including living expenses) and the reliability of your efforts to get you into your intended grad program. For the latter I would try to find others that have made it there to ask for their thoughts.\n\nGoing into debt is a risk when you want to have that money for grad school later. The research is key for grad apps, however, specifically the experience and networking. Your previous experience should help you find more opportunities wherever you go (I wouldn't worry about being behind, many students don't do research) but the availability of said opportunities is hard to see from an outside perspective. Knowing nothing about your intended program and other factors you care about (weather, location, student culture), I would avoid the debt unless Canisius is well-known as a stepping stone to grad school for X field.", "score": 1, "author": "Ellimes"}]}

Look up the professor you'll be taking using reddit or RateMyProfessor to know what pros and cons you may deal with \n\n3.

Email the teacher or visit office hours if you're confused or need help, just make sure you've already received help from your classmates before going to professor \n\n5. Attend your class and lectures. Yes you can't expect to pass a class with a high grade and sit at home\n\n6. Put in the effort, find ways that you can stay organized and manage your time, whether its a to do list or waking up early and getting things done \n\n7. Find ways to hack the system.

It says to be eligible you should have 30 semester units (which should be easy if you go to a community for a year) and you have to have your last semester of college prior to transferring be at a california community college (so as long as you drop out of your UC that you're currently at and aren't attending a University. basically only be attending community).\n\nThe only rule I can see about previously enrolled people is that would apply to you is:\n\n>Not eligible for a tag:...students previously enrolled at a UC campus during a regular term (not including summer session only) who plan to return to that same campus\n\nSo ig that means you just can't tag to the same UC that you're currently attending.\n\n>Does this give me a better shot at other UC schools?...If I want to aim for Cal or UCLA what are my chances?\n\nI would assume the same as any other community college transfer student.\n\n>So far I have a 4.0 GPA (Which might change to 3.8/3.9) but already finished most of my difficult classes.\n\nOne important thing to remember: community college have an \"articulation agreement\" with the UC's which you can find at [assist.org](https://assist.org). basically this is an agreement that says, \"This class at your community college is the same as this class at this UC. so if you complete this community college course, we'll give you credit for the corresponding UC class.\"\n\nUC's do not have articulation agreements with each other. So this means that the credits you completed at the UC may not transfer over once you go to your new UC (or at least it may not when the admission officer is looking at your application). Once you get into your desired campus, you may be able to petition to have the course transfer over, but you don't really get credit by default.\n\n>Will colleges care if I attend more that one CC? I had to mix and match because I decided on this last second.\n\nFor the most part, no. You can take some classes at one community college and some at another community college.\n\nThere could possibly be one exception being when you take classes that are a part of a sequence. For example, if you complete calculus 1 at a community college, some UC's will only count the credit if you also do calculus 2 and calculus 3 at the same community college. Some UC's don't want you mixing and matching within a sequence of courses.", "score": 1, "author": "Suicyclone", "page_title": "\n\t\t\tUniversity of California Counselors\n\t\t"}]}

Are there a lot of people in your school honors program? Or is the GPA lower in order to attract people? Is your school noted for harder grading, at least in a few academic areas, like killer STEM classes? Or were they smart enough to want to give that edge to more students?\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that in choosing who to accept the UCs mostly compare you and your qualifications to others at your same CC, and maybe the others nearby. So if you and someone else at your CC both want the same major, and that person has a 3.8 and not much else, your honors classes and related extracurricular stuff might make you at least equal. If one of your honors projects was a cool research paper or presentation on something that could have benefit for your community and you write an essay about it, that could give you a boost.

There was a higher number of accepted applicants from schools like SMCC to UCLA/UCI/Cal but the percentage was pretty much the same at all the CCs within an hour drive of us, including the small one 10 minutes away that she chose. Their honors program was affiliated with UCI but still working on UCLA. She wrote about her honors projects in that first PIQ in preparation and I think that helped her get into several schools, not just UCLA. Very few students did the honors program at that school - l think 10 a year graduated with honors and when she asked them to do the UCI paperwork it was obvious nobody had been using H2H because they didn\u2019t know how. Because it was not common I think honors put her near the top of applicants from her school, but she did also have very high grades so I could be overestimating it\u2019s impact. \n\nI\u2019m wishing you all the best and hope if you figure this out further you\u2019ll share.
