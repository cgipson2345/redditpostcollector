With thousands of colleges, how did you choose which to apply to?\n\nI applied to only five schools. Rice ED along with a range of public universities in my state (TX) that I had guaranteed admission to. Cost was my main motivator. My family were willing to support me as much as possible but couldn't really afford full COA at even a state school without loans, so I mostly focused on schools that I would have a good chance at receiving merit aid from, like UT Dallas, and schools that guaranteed good financial aid, like Rice. OOS public wasn't really an option as schools were a worse fit and/or way too expensive. Top-top schools didn't make as much sense either because I still would probably have gone to Rice over them anyway. It was hard for me to think of a scenario where I would go to really anywhere else, so I applied to only a few and don't regret it.\n\n\n>2. Why or why didn\u2019t you apply ED / EA?\n\nAfter visiting Rice, learning about their great financial aid, talking to students about campus culture, Computational and applied mathematics program, and knowing that I could fairly easily switch my major, it seemed like a very obvious #1 choice for me. \n\n>3. How did you balance the school year with the application process? Do you have any tips for next year\u2019s applicants to balance the two?\n\nAs above, I didn't apply to many places which helped a lot. Still ended up stressed as I kinda procrastinated on essays/asking for rec letters so definitely get on that. Also recommend running through all realistic scenarios and possible rejections/acceptances with your list. If there isn't a world where you end up at a specific school, just don't apply. Shotgunning has never really made sense to me but you do you.\n\n>4. When you received your first deferral / waitlist / rejection, what helped you deal with and move forward from your result?\n\nGot deferred from Rice but ended up being accepted everywhere. However there were lots of scholarships that I missed and was rejected from for my other schools that I really worried about over several months. I just tried to distract myself by hanging out with friends and family and staying on top of school and time flew by.\n\n>5. How did you make your final commitment decision? What factors did you consider?\n\nWith Rice's financial aid, it ended up being slightly cheaper than my best offer from a state school so it was a no-brainer for me. Although I might have been able to get better scholarships elsewhere if I applied sooner.\n\n>6. What is the one thing you wished you did differently at any point during the application process?\n\nI wish I had stayed organized and on top of applications sooner which probably would have alleviated some stress. Also would have maybe considered applying to certain LACs as alternate options.\n\nOverall, this is just one perspective and I know a lot of people that this wouldn't apply to at all. Just thought I'd share my success story where I didn't apply to a million schools.", "score": 18, "author": "L1darMonkey"}, {"id": "jij5z5a", "body": "With thousands of colleges, how did you choose which to apply to?\n\n\\-Since most colleges can be divided into small, medium, and large I first made a list of the pros and cons of each size college. Then I determined which size of college was the best fit for me. Hated the large colleges. I never want to sit in a classroom of 100 students ever. Couldn't care less about college level sporting events, actually totally not interested, even for the food part of the event so...., Very quickly figured out I wanted a small school learning environment. Fell in love with the LAC style.\n\nPrioritized what was most important to me for college: #1) LAC, #2) Diversity (not just found in the glossy brochure) #3) Language I wanted to learn #4) Study Abroad with $$ given for that purpose. I ranked the top 100 LACS based on these items stopping when I met the lower threshold. So for instance at some point it was nearly impossible to find LACs offering the language I wanted to learn below 50, had to go through nearly 25 more until I stumbled on a rare one that offered it.\n\nAt this point had about 20 possible LACs out of the top 100 LACs. You would be surprised when you go looking for if a school really has diversity (checked out their CDS and then read student comments on UNIGO to determine how minorities really felt about the school, also pinpointed how many international minorities were at the school vs. AA and HA also AsA to really get a feel if the diversity was due to lots of full pay internationals or a more balanced class) what you find. Lots of school that say they are diverse have minority students pointing out why that is a load of BS on Unigo. Very eye opening.\n\nNow to lower the number I plotted them on a map and ranked them based on distance to home because I am going to want to get home for Thanksgiving and Christmas and probably Spring break. This left me with 5 relatively local LACS. One Reach and Four Targets/Safeties\n\nI ED'd the Reach, I EA'd the 4 Target/Safeties. Just for protection I quickly applied to several in state publics, even though I didn't really want to go there. I EA'd to 3 in state schools. I left 5 schools for RD. These were schools that didn't offer EA or required application fees. 2 were reaches, 2 were targets/safeties.\n\nWhy or why didn\u2019t you apply ED / EA?\n\nED school was absolutely a long shot, visited 3 times, did the interview, jumped through all the hoops but abysmal acceptance rate means it was unlikely and the rejection was not a good feeling at all. School gave absolutely wonderful aid and NO loans so .... had to try.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEA schools was to get some acceptances under my belt and make me not feel so stressed. With no application fees for all of my EA schools it was a no brainer to just get it done early, also was considered for their priority scholarships decisions because of that.\n\nEA was the best thing I could have done. Had so many good choices to pick from via EA didn't even consider applying RD even to the reaches. So nice to be really done with apps when it seemed like everyone else was just getting going for RD.\n\nHow did you balance the school year with the application process? Do you have any tips for next year\u2019s applicants to balance the two?\n\nStart early. Started my essay in June after the end of Junior year. Started plugging stuff into Common App and before they updated it I just printed out a copy of everything I entered so I could retype it in to the new cycles CA form. Didn't actually lose much of anything when it reset so it was totally worth it to get started in the summer after my junior year.\n\nWhen you received your first deferral / waitlist / rejection, what helped you deal with and move forward from your result?\n\nI already had 4 acceptances via EA, I had a good 15 minute cry, I ate some cheesecake, I burned some of their merch in a symbolic gesture of anti-goodwill.\n\nHow did you make your final commitment decision? What factors did you consider?\n\nI pitted the top three local LACs that I had been admitted to against each other. I looked at the major I wanted to pursue and checked out their degree requirements, their faculty, their chairpeople for the major. Only one had the language I wanted to learn as a minor, when I checked the major class requirements one of the three stood out as having rigorous courses for the degree whereas the other two seemed like the degree requirements were a work in progress. When I checked the main professors for my major and minor so many at the winning LAC were listed as 4 or 5 stars even though they were ranked as highly difficult classes. If you know what you want to do for a major, good idea to find a top ranked school for that major and look at what classes they make their students take, are the ones at your intended school even remotely similar?  Or does it sound like a different major? That is a red flag in my book.\n\nWhat is the one thing you wished you did differently at any point during the application process? Actually, I think ultimately I did everything correctly.

ED'd to Penn, mostly because my brother goes there and his ED was successful so I thought I could recreate that.

Honestly I don't really have any specific advice for dealing with rejection, I guess I'd say to just keep your head up, I'm an optimist I believe things always work out and you'll end up where you're meant to be.

By 9th grade, print out the common app forms that teachers and counselors will use to evaluate you (way more than just academics - [take a look](https://membersupport.commonapp.org/membersupport/s/article/Are-paper-PDF-versions-of-the-application-and-or-recommender-forms-available)), and make choices accordingly. Line up recommenders early - choose clubs & classes to get lots of time with them. Start applications in the summer before Senior Year. ED/EA deadlines are super inconvenient with school going full tilt in Oct/Nov.\n\nSecond - choose extracurriculars that fit interests, but also have the opportunity to truly differentiate. The more common the extracurricular, the more you need to be prepared to achieve at the highest levels of performance (and that realistically ain't gonna happen with soccer, violin, football, piano, math club - there can be exceptions, but few and far between).  If you need athletics, individual sports are far easier for others to understand your accomplishments - state champ in wrestling, league champ in 400m.", "score": 3, "author": "soccerbill"}, {"id": "jiixawi", "body": ">With thousands of colleges, how did you choose which to apply to?\n\nSole factors were financial aid and prestige. In all honesty, I didn't consider campus life/dorms/food one bit. I only visited one of the colleges on my list before, and that was just because they were close to where I lived. I wouldn't say this is the best way to do things, but both should be huge factors when sending out applications. Prestige, more often than not, translates to high academic quality and having a degree whose name can get you into grad school/top jobs. Also, going into debt or being a financial strain to your family isn't preferable. I targeted schools that could meet full need for the most part. \n\n>\rWhy or why didn\u2019t you apply ED / EA\n\nI got hard rejected from my ED/ED2 so it doesn't really matter in the end, but like most other people, I was just attracted to the higher acceptance rate, and ability to get a decision sooner and relax for the rest of the year, instead of grinding applications after ED day in late December and having to stress for the entire spring. \n\n>How did you balance the school year with the application process? Do you have any tips for next year\u2019s applicants to balance the two?\n\nShort answer is that I didn't really. I ended up grinding out my supps during Thanksgiving and Winter break of my first semester, which honestly wasn't that bad as I had a bit of time to kill. Starting your applications in summer is undoubtedly a great way to maintain that balance. I will say that I just went with the flow of life all throughout my school year, rarely turning down invitations to hang out with friends, and being the most active in my ECs that I've ever been. Even with all the procrastination regarding college apps, it all worked out. \n\n>When you received your first deferral / waitlist / rejection, what helped you deal with and move forward from your result?\n\nI opened most of my initial decisions (ED/ED2/EAs) with friends while hanging out, and the vibes pulled me through pretty quickly. They were mainly schools that are hit-or-miss, even for the most insane applicants, so I expected a likely chance of rejection. All in all, keep in mind that many of these T30 schools that most of A2C is obsessed with have ultra-low acceptance rates, and decisions can be very unpredictable. Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't get your hopes up (but still, have confidence, and maintain a positive outlook at your cycle. The right one will come along).\n\n>How did you make your final commitment decision? What factors did you consider?\n\nOf course, my initial factors of financial aid and prestige played a role. I decided on committing to UC Berkeley. As a California resident, I ended up getting essentially full rides at every UC due to the way the numbers worked out with scholarships and aid and such, so I had great options in all of them. Berkeley is also one of the top universities in the world, and it's hard for even some Ivies to beat their reputation. \n\n>What is the one thing you wished you did differently at any point during the application process?\n\nI was unashamedly a shotgunner, and ended up getting rejected or waitlisted from the lion's share of the T20. If I was in the position that I was six or so months ago, I wouldn't have wasted all that time on my essays. Other than that, I wouldn't really say that I would do anything different, other than rethink my \"strategy\" if you will. My applications, while relatively stacked, were a hot mess. The importance of crafting a narrative, especially for some of the schools that do \"holistic\" review, is something that is to be emphasized.

Even for the most qualified of applicants, applying for financial aid as an international is a bloodbath. I think the first thing is to know your chances. They are low. No matter how good your application is. Expect to get rejected everywhere.\n\nKeeping this in mind, here are my tips for the actual application itself:\n\n1. Don't just rely on financial aid. There are many schools that are willing to give amazing merit scholarships that cover the full cost of tuition and even housing sometimes. Do your research and apply to these schools as well.\n2. Don't apply to ivy leagues w/out financial aid (if you really need it) just to see your chances. More often than not, if people end up getting in, they really want to go, and worst case, the loan out a bunch of money and end up going into debt. Your undergrad is NOT work 300K. Save that money for grad school.\n3. Consider schools from other countries! There are many schools that are amazing outside of the US, and if you care about prestige, there are schools that are ranked above a lot of ivies such as the University of Toronto or the National University of Singapore. Often times these schools give out merit scholarships/are cheaper, and have *way* better accommodations as well. Again, do your research.\n4. Keep your head up! It's really really difficult getting rejection after rejection when people around you are getting accepted to these amazing places. I still get quite upset sometimes and wonder if I would have been better off going into debt and applying without financial aid\u2014sometimes I feel really ashamed when people ask me where I committed to since they probably expect better.

This made me realize that I might have better chances at schools with higher acceptance rates. I also used my EA results to help me pinpoint where I needed to improve my application. For instance, I found out that UChicago places a lot of value on essays. After going back and re-reading my personal statement, I knew that I could have done a better job, so I took some time to revamp it.\n3. My top recommendation is to give yourself plenty of time for revisions and breaks during the writing process. In my experience, taking a few days off from my paper helped me come back to it with a fresh perspective, renewed energy, and more creativity. This break gave me the chance to relax and clear my head, which allowed me to write more effectively and produce a better final product.\n4.

I decided that I wanted to stay in New England, and possibly DC (for the internships and location) but that still didn\u2019t narrow it down. I then looked for schools that either had 1. Environmental Policy as a major, or 2. Environmental Studies and Political Science and I could easily double major and possibly take a minor if I wanted to. I tried to balance my schools, so that meant applying to a couple UMass schools, a couple more safeties that would very likely give me good merit aid, some target schools, and I ended up applying to a few reaches too.\n\n2. So I had always planned to apply ED. First, it was Colby College. It had my major, the academics were great, and they provided 100% of my demonstrated financial need. But I visited and hated that it was in the middle of nowhere, the weather (I visited in May and it was still like 40 outside), and a couple other things. So I was back to square one. Then, I visited Brown and fell in love. The open curriculum, the location, the campus itself. It was all amazing, and since they meet 100% of demonstrated need, I decided to apply ED. However, I got rejected (as was expected). I also applied EA to all of the schools that I could, and this proved to be pretty helpful, because I got into a bunch of schools I\u2019d be happy at with good merit aid, and so for my RD round I could just apply to reaches if I wanted to.\n\n3. For me, working on my essays over the summer was the biggest help. You can actually start on your common app before August, and then the information you put in will roll over. So, I did that in the spring of my junior year, and once we received confirmation that the prompts for the Common App would stay the same, I started working on them. I went through a lot of iterations before I got to what I felt like best represented me, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that if I started even at the beginning of the school year. So, those are my tips - just start early, and leave enough time for supplementals too.\n4. So my first rejection was Brown, but to be honest, I knew I was probably going to get rejected, so idk if that counts. Instead, I\u2019ll talk about a school I really thought I was going to get into: George Washington University. My guidance counselors and everyone told me that I\u2019d likely get in, based off of the profiles of the students that had been accepted from my school in past years. I was banking on getting in, and then I got waitlisted. That hit me pretty hard, because since I had been banking on getting in, I had been deciding between GW and the school I ultimately committed to. What helped me deal with it is that I realized that even if I had gotten in, I likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it, because GW is notoriously stingy with aid. Also, I am not a huge fan of DC weather (it gets too hot for me). But honestly, I would recommend looking at all the pros of the schools you did get into, and weighing whether or not it really would have been worth it at the school you got rejected from.\n\n5. As I just said, I had been deciding between GW and the school I ultimately committed to, UVM. At UVM, I got into the LASP program, which is a living/learning community you need to apply for with a capped enrollment. This, along with the massive merit scholarship I got there, and the reputation of the school\u2019s environmental program, helped me decide to go there. I will have to take out minimal loans to go, and that was a consideration for me too- at my state school, UMass Lowell, I wouldn\u2019t have had to take out any, and I got a stipend for study abroad. However, I didn\u2019t think the campus fit was right for me. I would\u2019ve been happy at Lowell, I know, but I really think I\u2019m going to succeed a lot at UVM. Idk how to describe it, but it was just the vibes.\n\n6. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve changed anything about how I applied. Yes, I could have applied to less schools and just skipped the RD round entirely, but I think I would regret it and constantly be wondering \u201cwhat if?\u201d I also wish I knew how much college admissions can hinge on privilege. When I saw that other kids from my school (who, tbh, didn\u2019t have as good of an academic record as me [i.e. were constantly skipping class, not participating, etc. and weren\u2019t even in AP classes] but were definitely full pay) getting into schools that I didn\u2019t, it made me question if everything I did was worth it, and just made me wonder.

Do you have any tips for next year\u2019s applicants to balance the two?\n\nI couldn't. I had A Levels, so it was around August I began the entire process of researching + longlisting and drafting essays. Unfortunately by the time I got everything rolling it was October and I barely had 3 months before my IALs and I barely started studying.

Crafting essays while studying for IALs weren't easy at all.\n\nTo the upcoming cycle, if you want to put off something big for the last moment only put off one thing, not two like me who then got ruthlessly ass fucked with essays, CSS, IALs and everything in between!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When you received your first deferral / waitlist / rejection, what helped you deal with and move forward from your result?\n\nFrom Canada: UAlberta in around November, but it was conditional.

I got 8 rejections in the span of 3 days. It was brutal. I was completely left in shambles. I was thinking how I would approach my parents with that news since they had put on so much hope in me. I went on weeks without eating or sleeping properly and my parents got extremely annoyed by my irregular habits. I could only put faith in God to help me pass through that. Within that time I did sketch out a contingency in the case I got rejected from every place I applied to. That eased my mind since I had a fallback plan.

This sub mitigated that gap, but I was still quite lonely.

This is pretty much only for California public schools (UCs/CSUs) since that is where I applied.\n\n* Apply to a rolling admission school that guarantees a decision in a short time frame or apply early action somewhere. I applied to a few rolling admission schools (CSUs), but they did not inform me of my acceptance until late January at the earliest. Some CSUs send decisions earlier, so be sure to look into that, but the three I applied to SFSU, CPP, and Cal Poly did not send decisions until much later. My friends got really quick decisions from cal poly humboldt, sonoma state, CSUMB, and CSUSM, to name a few, while SFSU, SJSU, SDSU, Cal poly, CPP, and CSULB did not send out decisions until January or later). During December and January, I was freaking out since I had no decisions while all my friends had several, and I would not recommend going through that stress.\n* Pick safeties you actually would go to. Every year, 'target schools' are becoming more difficult so do not rely on your targets and apply to multiple safeties. (a 50% acceptance rate is not a safety anymore tbh). There was a brief point where I thought I only would have my safeties to pick from, and I didn't really love any of them, mainly because I only applied because my school counselor and parents told me to. So definitely research your safeties and become excited for them as well.\n* Alternate majors don't really make much of a difference. I did not get admitted anywhere under an alt major, and I don't really know anyone that did either (except at UCSB, which seems to admit a lot of people under their alt majors for some reason, but I didn't apply there). If you are applying under a competitive major, just know that your alternate major may not save you from a waitlist or rejection. \n* I am really glad that I got all my apps done before Nov 30! I would definitely recommend getting them all done early so you can have a nice winter break and come into second-semester senior year strong (because, trust me, you need a strong foundation). \n* Make a spreadsheet to organize your colleges. I really love spreadsheets for organization, and everything is right next to each other to compare/contrast\n* Results from schools don't make sense at all. I got waitlisted at Davis and thought that I was done for, but literally a week later, I was reading a UCLA acceptance letter, so don't read into the decisions too much. \n* Also, try not to do too much speculation or reading deeper into things before you get your decision (i.e. \"omg my portal looks slightly different\" or \"I got the marketing email literally everyone gets.

I spaced out the supplemental essays for the schools I really cared about (my ED school and my other favorite ones) and started drafting in August but I didn\u2019t really have most of my supplementals done until the night before they were due.

Have a good idea of what you want to write about, and grind during your school breaks. You'll thank yourself for doing so during the school year. Also devote a day of the week to working on applications, and try to make a schedule for yourself! Honestly I didn't keep to mine (and regretted it later), but it'll keep you motivated and on track if it works for you.

I considered the freedom and quality I would get in terms of opportunities and education (eg funded study abroad & travel opportunities, tons of world leader visits, and lectures from world's foremost experts), but also future prospects in terms of networking, job opportunities, and school support. I also really liked the environment and the city my school was in; a lot of my high school friends go to school in the area, and it's a really safe city that's wonderful to explore. I also considered the social scene; my school's a place where the party scene isn't dominant.

I think my app showed these attributes pretty well through my essays and ECs. Readers will then indicate their decision, ranging from \"do not recommend\" to \"strongly recommend\". This isn't the final decision; files are then reviewed again by the College you applied to and then final offers are made.\n\nI also saw how Berkeley compares you to students at your HS. I was ranked in the 75% percentile in terms of GPA which kinda confused me cuz I thought I was top 9% through the guaranteed UC admission notif I got in high school. They also look at the average AP score at your high school, the most rigorous math/science courses, and how many APs you took out of the APs offered.\n\nI also learned that to be nominated as a Regents' and Chancellor's Scholar, you have to be written down as one by at least one of your readers.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Currently a fourth year med student and have been lurking on this subreddit for a bit, mainly shook at how in the heck college got this competitive (even just in the last decade). I really feel for you all and you are killing it \ud83d\ude4c.\n\nI have been seeing a common theme that I wanted to discuss, mainly people stating that undergrad prestige does not matter for med school. I just wanted to add my perspective as you are all deciding. \n\nI\u2019m currently at a T3 med school, went to a T10 undergrad, and had the opportunity to sit on the admissions committee for my med school too, for context.\n\nIt is true that you can go to a medical school from any college, but it really really helps if you go somewhere prestigious, especially if you want to go somewhere in the T40 I\u2019d say. There\u2019s both direct and indirect reasons for this.\n\n1. A greater percentage of your graduating class can go somewhere really good. I know classmates who had to grind their butt off to get to this med school coming from their state school, because they were going to be the only person that got admitted at our med school, being the very top of their class. Meanwhile there\u2019s like 80% of the class from a T20 college. There are 11 people from my undergrad alone, and let me tell you I was a solid upper middle performing student in college.\n\n2. Medicine, like law, business, etc. is all just an insiders game. Getting letters of recommendation in college from a physician or researcher at a prestigious university goes a long way for your app, and there\u2019s even a chance the person interviewing you in med school knows the recommender professionally/personally. This happened to me a few times on the interview trail.\n\n3. Plenty of cutting edge research that you get involved in as an undergrad that makes you look cool in interviews. Even if you did the same pipetting that someone did elsewhere. \n\n4. For many prestigious colleges, getting good grades is actually easier (yes even Hopkins and MIT). They know many people are going to graduate school + they want to attract students to come. There\u2019s significant grade inflation vs. mid tier or state schools, at least from my n = 1 experience. And the worst part is, as above, you still get the benefit of the doubt if you do do poorly.\n\n5. Pre med committees definitely do a better job with more personalized committee letters.\n\nSame thing can be/is said of med school going to residency. There are simply some specialties or hospitals that are just impossible or way harder to match into if you go to a lower ranked med school.\n\nAll in all it\u2019s a rigged system, you would think that your MCAT should speak for itself, but the people accepting med students are considering the profile and perceived prestige of their incoming class.\n\nThe system does not benefit people who don\u2019t have the privilege of paying these huge tuitions and you definitely should not take full loans for undergrad if you can. I was fortunate to get scholarship for college but I will have about 200k in loans after training.\n\nI just want to add my $0.02. I know many of you are crazy high achieving and I assume that you\u2019d want to continue that in your career, so it\u2019s a bit of a blindside to say that you can go to a high rank med school just as easily from any college. Of course if you are motivated and smart you can push yourself to do anything.

My school is an allopathic state medical college with a stated mission of training primary care physicians (though an increasing number of students in recent years are matching into surgical subspecialties and each year we have a handful of students match into hyper-competitive fields like derm, ophtho, rads, etc.) Having served on the admissions committee for three years, I can unequivocally state that this school could not care less where an applicant did their undergraduate work. The undergrad GPA is far more important than the school. Also, as a smaller state school, our committee was not significantly swayed by medical research. Even the MCAT score wasn\u2019t that important beyond a certain point. We could easily have filled the entire class with applicants with near-perfect MCAT scores, but that was not the direction our school was wanting. With the MCAT, all we really cared about was a score demonstrating enough mastery of the core science content that the student would be able to handle the pre-clinical curriculum and pass USMLE Steps 1 and 2 on the first try. The most important things for our school\u2019s consideration were GPA, service, demonstrated commitment to medicine, clinical experience, and character (i.e., our school fostered a collaborative environment so the committee tried to weed out most of the hyper-competitive grade-grubbers, though of course a few slipped through every year anyway.) The committee also tended to give extra looks at non-bio majors, as they often had more interesting stories and were better able to distinguish themselves from the crowd.\nI can\u2019t speak for other medical schools, but just wanted to point out that the majority of practicing U.S. physicians did not graduate from a top 25 research oriented school. Most physicians in this country graduated from less prestigious state medical colleges. So if someone\u2019s goal is to practice medicine in anything but the most competitive specialities- that can be easily achieved by starting anywhere, including community college, lower ranked directional state colleges, etc. On the other hand, someone hoping to match in dermatology at Mass General will want to aim for the best possible medical school to make those connections, so I can see the value of attending a higher ranked undergraduate college in that case.\nFinally- also wanted to add that the few students each year who did match to highly competitive residencies from my school spent much of their 4th year doing rotations at other schools as well as taking research electives, getting high enough grades to make AOA 3rd year if possible, and basically working much harder than the rest of us. So it\u2019s still possible to get there- just likely much harder from a lower ranked school.\nQuestion: what do you call the person who graduates last in their class from the worst medical school in America?\nAnswer: Doctor.", "score": 75, "author": "Individual-Table-925"}, {"id": "jixu49v", "body": "this feels like selection bias.", "score": 20, "author": "catolinee"}, {"id": "jixxh7u", "body": "This sub is focused on high achieving HSers probably top 5% of students but the sub is obsessed with getting into the top 1% of schools so 80% are considered failures.\n\nCongrats OP but seriously a post on T3 med school admissions while informative isn\u2019t really helpful for HSers who haven\u2019t survived organic chemistry yet.

Yes, it is as bad as I describe especially in over subscribed majors.\n\nOne more thing, contrary to what someone (who clearly does not know what they are talking about) Your grades at UW Madison are not necessarily going to be better than UWash or Barnard. Columbia has grade inflation in some departments and grade deflation in others. So if you choose courses in a department famous for grade deflation (eg some Biology tracks, BME and EE) and so on versus majors like Psychology, Econ and so on you might find you have a very different GPA. So I would not try optimize for GPA especially since none of these schools are famous for grade deflation/grade inflation.

I was a slightly above average high school student (public school, 4.2, 1430 SAT, music ecs, etc.) but was in no way T50 material. I come from a middle class family who's household income is just enough not to receive any financial aid but no where near enough to afford 60k/yr, so if I did not go to a full-ride I would have to take out loans.\n\nApplied to a bunch of public and private schools and ultimately decided to go to my state public school  (ranked outside of US News Top200) on a full-ride. Those private schools I weighing (looking at you Baylor and Southern Methodist) charge huge tuitions for decent academic facilities. Except, they will largely not give you any type of career boost vs your state's flagship public. At the end of the day, these schools are run like business and try to game the US News ranking to increase applicants and drive down admissions rates. I know it is harder to see when you are in high school, but I promise you do not want to be in your mid-twenties paying loans when your colleagues are making just as much as you with no loans.\n\nCaveat 1: this does not apply to the T20 universities where going there actually does have an impact if you are a career motivated person.\n\nCaveat 2: I went into college already knowing the profession I wanted to go into which gave me a large leg up against those who were figuring out what they wanted to do.\n\nCaveat 3: I working in an accounting/finance field where after 4 few years of experience my total compensation is about $170k. Obviously, there are bankers, consultants, and engineers coming out of HYP making more, but I promise in 90% of professional fields your undergrad degree does not mean shit after a few years. You are either a performer or non-performer. A lot of my coworkers went to private schools and yet our teams are about 50/50 public and private all making the same salaries.\n\nCaveat 4: If you are from a lower socio-economic class, going as high up the ladder is your best bet as financial aid is widely more available. My argument mostly applies to middle class applicants.\n\nI say this out of heart because my family member was mentioning a lot of colleges that were trying to sell her on experiences and the opportunity to study there often touting their rankings. However, if you dig into their employment reports they often don't have better outcomes than their public counterparts. \n\nTl;dr please don't listen to the marketing and the noise of private schools and make an educated decision based on what you want to do with your career.

By doing well, basically you need to perform well on your inpatient clerkships and get your attendings to write you good letters.  IM residency then sets you up for medicine specialties 3 years later.  We are matching IM residents at our prestigious academic medical center from medical schools all over the country.  I would say pretty much the same for general surgery residency but it is slightly more competitive. Since general surgery residency then leads to most specialty surgical fellowships, as long as you match in a halfway decent surgical program out of med school you should be fine.  The only exception is if you want to do a combined program - like a 5 year cardiothoracic program (I would recommend against this).\n\n\\-pediatrics, psychiatry, PM&R, neurology, pathology are all pretty easy to match in.  It may be hard to match at the world's best pediatric program from a lesser med school, but you will match somewhere good.\n\n\\-For the ROAD specialties (radiology, opthalmology, anesthesia (somewhat) and dermatology) it actually does matter where you go to medical school.

At some schools, many more than you might realize, admitted students whose family incomes are below a fairly high figure are routinely offered a lot of financial aid. Families who can clearly afford the tuition are not. Seems fair enough. \n\nIf I buy a nice older car advertised for sale at $10,000, but. after some negotiation, I end up paying $8,000, what was the price of that car? Well, it's not $10K, that's for sure. \n\nThe school I'm most familiar with is my own alma mater, Colgate University. Colgate's tuition is also very high, though not as high as these schools. But it has also has a huge financial aid system to help students pay for their education. Here it is from the website: \n\n\"Students with an annual family income of $80,000 or less will attend Colgate tuition-free.\" No tuition at all, and that includes books and everything. \n\n\"Students with annual family income levels between $80,000 and $175,000 will pay a percentage of annual income toward tuition.\" This normally reduces tuition by a very large amount: \"$80,000\u2013$125,000: 5% of income toward tuition, on average. $125,000\u2013$175,000: 10% of income toward tuition, on average.\" \n\n\"Students with annual family income levels up to $175,000 will have their federal loans replaced with grants.\" That means you aren't graduating with a large college loan burden to deal with. \n\nI'd say this is pretty fair, and for many (most?) families, it makes paying for a top-quality college education much less of a burden than a raw \"tuition amount\" would suggest. And it covers nearly all students. So what is Colgate's tuition -- really? It depends on your income and what you can afford. Stating tuition costs without even mentioning tuition reduction programs is very misleading.

If there is an anomaly you want to state regarding your academic performance, you would do so in your personal statements.\n\nGrades are relative, and they differ from high school to high school.

Also, APs might be considered individually, so the right question to ask would be: Is my B is of a subject that is not directly related to my intended major?\n\nEven so, any top school would dislike low grades.

However, they are given time to see their financial aid package AND someone claimed the AO told them that the financial aid office is running behind on reviewing applications so there could be delays on when folks actually have to accept or pass.

Median first-year salary is $93k and average is $102.2k.   \nRPI Technology: Average salary is $105k.   \nCollegefactual: according to collegefactual, RPI CS BS has a median of 83.8K and RIT CS BS has a median of 84.7k. \n\nRIT salary seemingly being higher on average might be canceled out by the fact that you actually graduate earlier and can get a job earlier at RPI but idk. tie?\n\n **CAMPUS**\n\n *Exterior* \n\nRPI campus is beautiful, while RIT campus is a bunch of brick buildings that mostly look the same  \n\n*Dorms*\n\nRPI freshman dorms are bigger and look nicer, while the actual dorm buildings are generally better/look nicer at RIT.   \nTunnel system at RIT for when it's cold that lets you get to some other places faster  \n\nRPI 100% wins here\n\n**Social**\n\n*Clubs/Activities* \n\nWay more clubs I'm interested in at RIT than RPI (7 at RPI, \\~10 at RIT)   \nRIT has tora-con (seems really fun + has some really cool voice actors)   \nRPI has genericon but it seems to have shut down after covid??? \n\n *People*  \nI know two friends are going to RIT, but nobody I know is going to RPI   \nAlready been talking to a potential RIT roommate & people in the RIT discord and they seem really chill   \nRPI discord has a few people that seem cool at least  \n\noverall RIT is winning in terms of people i've actually spoken to and stuff I'd be interested in doing\n\n**Price per year**   \nRIT: \\~53k   \nRPI:  \\~$51k    \nbasically the same. 4 years of tuition for both\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr RPI academics seem better, co-op/job stats for RIT seem better but may be canceled out by 5 years to graduate versus 4 at RPI, RPI campus better, social stuff like people I know going there and clubs/activities seems better at RIT, price is slightly better at RPI. help", "title": "Help choosing between RIT and RPI (CS student)", "id": "1384zvh", "score": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1384zvh/help_choosing_between_rit_and_rpi_cs_student/", "permalink": "/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/1384zvh/help_choosing_between_rit_and_rpi_cs_student/", "author": "RITvRPIThrowaway", "comments": [{"id": "jiwy98r", "body": "I'm biased towards RIT because my son is finishing his sophomore year in CS over there, and is loving the overall experience.\n\nBut you seem to have a clear preference for RPI.

I totally get the feeling of disappointment, especially when you wanted and expected to go somewhere else. I was effectively pushed by my family to go to community college back in the day (mom wouldn't pay if I went anywhere but CC, and refused to take me to look at any colleges I was considering, and I didn't have my license at that point to take myself) and I hated every minute I was there at first because I just did not want to be there. I wound up dropping out and re-enrolling in community college several years later, and the experience was totally fine when I actually took it seriously on my second go round. When I went to apply for transfer after finishing my AA, I applied to four fairly selective schools and got two acceptances and a waitlist (and one reject) so it's not like anyone will ding you for coming from community college. (I wound up not enrolling in any of them because they were all too expensive, but that's another story) \n\nYou also don't even necessarily have to do a full two years, or even one full year at community college if you don't want to. You can always apply to transfer out after one semester, but I promise it's not the end of the world even if you do stay to complete your Associate's, and in the long run it is cheaper.\n\nBesides that, if you don't want to go to CC, there are plenty of public schools that use rolling admissions. A number of schools also have online degree programs which are *usually* catered towards working adults, and these often have later deadlines than conventional schools. Yeah, some of these places are the less prestigious diploma mills you can probably think of, but there are some legit good schools that have this option as well. Off the top of my head, I know both UW Madison and Villanova have flexible online programs. So your only options aren't necessarily \"go to community college or only go to a very expensive school\".\n\nBut lastly, I promise it's not the end of the world if you take some time off. Again, I totally get that it sucks and I personally understand the disappointment. But look man, I didn't even go back to community college until I was 26, and because I fucked around a lot on my first go round (because I didn't want to be there) until I dropped out I wasn't eligible for financial aid at first upon my return, so it took me longer than the usual 4 semesters to complete my AA, and then because I was too stupid to have a cheap fallback the first time I applied for transfer I wound up unintentionally taking some extra time off until apps for the next semester opened. But now after all of that I am doing okay.\n\nIf you want to take the summer and reapply to come in during the spring, or take a year and try again for next year, I promise it's going to be alright. I'm not trying to invalidate any feelings you may have because I totally get from personal experience that it sucks, but I promise that you have options and it's not the end of the world.", "score": 2, "author": "TiberiusCornelius"}, {"id": "jiswuc4", "body": "Try any colleges with rolling admissions or a later application deadline, then maintain the best grades possible and transfer out", "score": 2, "author": "Automatic-Ebb-6905"}, {"id": "jithsf0", "body": "Idk where you are located or if you would at all be interested, but UK universities do something called 'clearing', where certain schools across Britain reopen their admissions during the summer if they have spots left open. \n\nCertainly could be an option if you're really against CC.

I got into UVA, William & Mary, Williams, and Amherst, and I'm still waiting to hear from Swarthmore, Penn, Cornell, and Brown which I feel like there's a chance I might get at least one more acceptance out of those.\n\nMy situation is completely different than the straight out of high school to community college for two years to a top school story, but I do know of a handful of people at my school who did that and ended up at top LACs, a few at Brown, a few at Stanford, and one at Harvard. It's possible, but like every other aspect of the transfer process, you need to do everything perfectly and still get extremely lucky.\n\nEdit: My advice, and this is what I did, is set your goal to be to get into your state's top school and just try to be happy with that outcome. If you get into anywhere incredible out of state, even better, but if not, you'll still be at a great school. With my history, I thought I would be lucky to get into Virginia Tech, let alone UVA.", "score": 1, "author": "Interesting-Plane-75"}]}

I can go to a crappy Israeli university and not do the Mechina but I really don't wanna do that. \n\nI've been super depressed for a month because of it so I packed a bag and went to Europe for like 2 weeks with some money I saved up and now i realize I have like 2 days to make a choice and I really don't know what to do.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "***just to clarify this is not a chance-me post I already know my chances are nill :( but I'm trying to make an effort to at least give me a chance***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe colleges I'm applying to are way beyond my league, I wanted to know what I can do to stand out to be accepted at one of these colleges, my list is:\n\nMIT, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, UC Berkeley, Caltech, University of Washington, Georgia Institute of Technology, UC San Diego, UC Los Angeles, Cornell University\n\nMy major is Data Science/Computer Science and I'm hoping to become a cybersecurity analyst or engineer\n\nIn terms of g.p.a well, I'm an international student but also I'm not? My syllabus is A-Levels but I have a US passport as I was born there, My predicted grades are A\\*A\\*A\\*A\\*A\\* for Math, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, and Further Maths (which my school doesn't offer as a subject but I'm learning it on my own and writing as a private candidate), in AS I took English(mandatory in the first year), math, physics, chem, and cs. All of which I get my grades for on the 24th, for which ill make another update. I'm taking 5 A levels because the normal amount is 3-4 so i wanted to seem better relatively plus taking a harder subject that the school doesnt offer also looks good\n\nTaking the SAT on the 6th but on my psat i'm consistently getting 1520 with 800 in math and 720 in English consistently, this is my first sat so hopefully by the second one I can super score above 1550\n\nIn terms of extracurriculars, this is where im most worried, I placed as a finalist with a team of 6 in a national robotics competition (3rd place), and uh, that's it really for now, Im decent at chess and badminton, chess there are state-level tournaments every month that I'm hoping to participate in, badminton, the school said they would arrange something for me. I'm planning to start a Community service club in our school, I wouldn't be the first to start a club but the other one failed miserably (which is sad because it was an astrophysics club and that sounds sick) that checks off both community service and leadership for me, all my classmates (class of 16 people) are willing to join it, and I can easily get people from other classes. I'm working as an intern for my dad's startup (the startup itself is confidential but I'm working as a programmer there) which my career counselor says counts as shadowing a professional.\n\nI think the biggest aspect of my application is the research project I'm going to be working on, I signed up with Polygence and got accepted into the program (although they have yet to find a mentor) the paper is about present and future cybersecurity measures against malicious AI use (deepfaking, voice modules, illegal image generation)\n\nAnd ill be receiving recommendations from most of my teachers, the career counselor and even the head of school\n\nSo what's the issue here, Im not really the best of the best but maybe i can get into a safer college on the list right? NAH, I'm Indian (even though i was born and raised in California) so I'm technically part of the asian crowd moreover im applying for financial aid, this makes my application worth nothing compared to my competition, So what can I still do?

Reddit isn't letting me post this in one chunk, so I'll split it up. The rest is under the post as two comments. As a fellow c/o '27 JHU and Cornell engineering admit who chose JHU, and also got a lot of pro-Cornell comments on their post, I would suggest you consider Hopkins.\n\nQuick disclaimer: I'm doing BME, so the choice was no doubt a bit easier for me, BUT DON'T DISREGARD ME JUST YET! I'm strongly considering doing electrical engineering instead, and a lot of my reasons had nothing to do with the schools' respective engineering programs. I tried to focus on non-BME things here.\n\nQuick disclaimer #2: I'm definitely biased, but I gave my reasons for Cornell as well to try to stay objective. If anyone reads something here that they disagree with, please respond or clarify for the sake of transparency. I'm not omniscient!\n\nFirst, I want to defocus from rankings for my entire response. Colleges aren't arbitrarily the best in a major, but you have to look at their programs' specific metrics and offerings to see which you'll get more out of. If you're still concerned with engineering rankings, I'll get it out of the way here. Cornell engineering is ranked #13 overall on USNWR, and JHU engineering is #14; not a meaningful difference, and although this does get more exaggerated as you look at individual engineering majors, JHU is still T20 for both CS and MechE. If we're talking rankings overall, JHU is #7 and Cornell is #17, so...\n\nI spoke to a lot of people before making my decision and I got the sense that Cornell engineering is brutally difficult to do well in. I was told that average unweighted test grades can hover around 50, and classes are typically curved around a B or B+, or a 3.0-3.3; graduating GPAs below 3.5 or even 3.0, as I've heard, are common. Multiple people told me that adjusting during freshman year was disproportionately difficult. GPA can, in some cases, be an issue for declaring a major in the CoE, which requires that prerequisite courses be at C+ or above. At JHU, classes are supposedly curved around an A-, and the average GPA for BME is 3.76 (as I was told by an admin during a BME info session), although admittedly dated online sources say that this can be closer to 3.5 for all engineering disciplines. This was important to me because GPA matters for grad school, as does research (where both are good but JHU is better, #1 by research expenditure in the US by a margin of ~$1.5 billion, anyone?), and it might matter to you, too. GPA is less important for industry, but you'll likely want a graduate degree eventually to jump up that pay scale, and some companies have minimum GPAs.\n\nEven more important for me was the additional flexibility offered by the Whiting school. Every Cornell engineer has told me that it is basically impossible to double major in engineering (and you can't double major across schools, either, unlike JHU), unless you're doing ECE and CS (which is still supposedly difficult, but manageable). As someone with passions across many fields of engineering, this was a red flag. JHU, on the other hand, is much more double-major- friendly. With many Whiting majors overlapping and the lack of a core curriculum (which may be a benefit for you in and of itself), double majoring is much more common and manageable, workload-wise. People tell me they have double majored successfully in completely different majors. So, if you really want to double major in MechE and CS, JHU could be the right choice.", "score": 8, "author": "sliceoftau"}, {"id": "jiskmd5", "body": "Cornell. 100%.", "score": 10, "author": "grendelone"}, {"id": "jist28d", "body": "Cornell!", "score": 5, "author": "No_Finger3889"}, {"id": "jist2od", "body": "Cornell!", "score": 6, "author": "No_Finger3889"}, {"id": "jit4qcf", "body": "Cornell", "score": 5, "author": "TheAvgLebowski"}, {"id": "jisvrhs", "body": "Cornell", "score": 6, "author": "throwaway-2739"}, {"id": "jisunkv", "body": "Johns Hopkins especially if you want biomedical engineering.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "I've already gotten into a college. Yay! \n\nPart of me is really excited, but another part of me is also filled with dread about the future. \n\nI really want to become a professor. There are so many academics that I look up to and I'd love to spend my days researching and teaching. I've had some really great teachers in my life who've made me think and look at the world in completely different ways. I want to be like that for other people. I want to be a positive force in the world. However, everyone knows academia pays horribly for most people. Most academic jobs are part-time/adjunct. These professors have none of the benefits of full time tenured professors, but the same responsibilities. I've heard of cases where adjuncts have had to work second jobs in the service industry (ironically their jobs at fast food places pay more than their adjunct salary), being homeless, or on welfare. I don't want that for myself. I'd like to live a comfortable life. Ideally, I'd like to make enough money so that I can send my kids to a school like Andover and the don't have to even think about applying for scholarships or financial aid, but alas.\n\nMy plan b job (really my plan a because academia is a pipe dream) is to be a lawyer. I think I'd like to do something in constitutional or human rights law. I'd love to help oppressed people fight and overturn these systems of oppression. The pay is definitely better than academia, but still as much as I'd like. Then there's big law/corporate law. Corporate law is probably one of the more lucrative legal fields aside from IP and Patent law. It would provide a comfortable lifestyle, but also I'd be selling my soul to a corporation. I wouldn't be helping people. If anything I'd be screwing people over if I were a corporate lawyer. \n\nI get that I'm probably catastrophizing, but it seems as if the only options I have are to pursue my dreams and work long hours for practically nothing or sell my soul, while working hours just as long, and make a lot of money.

Do not get caught up in \u201cprestige.\u201d Look at the faculty in your student\u2019s major and see if their area of study is interesting to your child. \u201cPrestigious\u201d schools are (usually) not uniformly good across all subjects.\n5. Look at where these schools send their graduates. The school\u2019s career office can tell you who hires their alums, and the academic offices should also be able to tell you the grad schools they send their grads to.\n6. Alumni networks can be really important in getting jobs. I know some \u201cprestige\u201d schools where alumni could care less about helping a recent grad out, and some schools are famous for alumni support of grads, and the most helpful alumni are not from the schools you might you think. One of my schools was amazing that way, and the others, not so much.\n7. Do not do extracurriculars just for show. Have your kid do the stuff you are passionate about. Admissions knows that spending 2 weeks at a Mexican orphanage is just performative, as are most of the clubs, etc. Make sure your kid has friends, is physically active and develops life skills because that is more likely to secure your kid\u2019s success and happiness than going to any particular school.\n8. I went to some great schools, but those guys that are still talking about where they went to college 10, 20, 30 years after they graduate (you know these knuckleheads) are just so, so sad. Some of the most lost people I have ever met went to the prestige schools, usually because their parents and peers wanted them to go and they never asked themselves what they wanted.\n9. Some industries are very, very local, and they tend to hire local grads. That should go into your calculus as well.\n10. Meet current students, alums and professors when school is in session. Your kid will know when the vibe is right.\n11. Have reasonable expectations. Legacies mean much less than they used to. For many schools, once they admit their sports teams, legacies, underrepresented students, there just aren\u2019t that many slots left. Sometime there is a strategic bias for one type of student versus another. Sometimes that works in your favor. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\n12. Some of these schools have applicants that are freakishly amazing. I was judging a business plan competition and a freshman with a music software company idea presented. I asked what he knew about the music business. He asked me if I had seen one particular famous movie. When I answered yes he told me he had written the soundtrack. All the club presidencies in the world can\u2019t compete with that.\n13. Julie Lythcott-Haims, ex-Dean of freshman and undergraduate advising at Stanford had a meeting for parents at my kids\u2019 school and said that I know most of you went to amazing schools, but understand it is a very different time, especially post-Covid and most of your kids won\u2019t get into the same schools that you got into. We all grumbled but she was largely right. That doesn\u2019t mean give up.

Your kid truly might be accomplished enough to get into these schools but it is so so much more competitive and difficult than you think right now, like, sub 5% acceptance rates and they're still dropping, getting your heart set on a school and thinking you have a chance only to get rejected will hurt so so much more than having a realistic understanding of their chances and not depending on that acceptance, idk your kid So agian, maybe he does have a decent shot, but after a point top college admissions are unfair and random, especially with STEM since it's been so competitive in recent years to the point where ifs become a bit of a joke of young men from the bay area in computer science trying to get the same spots in top schools since it can feel like that's half the people on here sometimes, \n\nYou need to figure out how much you can pay a year, especially since you've got another kid going into college right after the other goes, and consider if either might want to do grad scgool. My family were shocked by how much it costs, they never thought it could be that much, we're talking 60k a year after need based and merit aid at some schools, so 240k total. Pick a few schools and run the net price calculator to see an estimate of what you might pay and see if it's reasonable. Have an honest conversation with your kid in junoir year and tell him how much you can pay and how much in loans you're willing to take out, this will give him a starting point to look at to see if something is out of his price range and so he knows how much wiggle room he has with costs. Otherwise he might just go and decide some school is his dream school without realizing 40k a year (160k) would not be a great idea, love everything about it, imagine himself going there, and be devastated when he realizes that yall can't afford it.\nHe needs to know there's no shame in going to a saftey school with an 80% acceptance rate if he has good oppurtinires there and it's the best option financially, some student will feel like they've failed by not getting into a top 20 school or something like that but sometimes it's not a good fit, it's not fesiable, or they just didn't get in, he needs to know that it dosent mean he failed if he dosent get into any of these super competitive schools. I have a 4.4 gpa, 8 Dual Enrollment classes and 1 AP, and over 150 hours of volunteer work and I got rejected from every school I applied to with less than a 50% acceptance rate including a target I had a decent chance at, and while my essays weren't thr best or anything which would have definitely helped, good stats on their own are not enough anymore, \nHelp him be realistic with where he can apply and probobly get in and where you can afford while being supportive and not being too harsh as best you can because unrealistic expectations could set him up for failure or heartbreak", "score": 2, "author": "books3597"}, {"id": "jis9n8q", "body": "Generally: it's way way way more expensive (elite privates are over 300K total for four years and even the UCs are 160K for four years with no fin-aid), you have to apply to 4-6x the number of schools, schools that used to be \"safeties\" are now have single digit acceptance rates, and the whole thing is brutal and horrific for all involved. It's BAD. I'm guessing you're my age or possibly a tick older... you know how you could apply to maybe 4, 5 schools and know you'd get in somewhere and not stress too much about it? I know a student who applied to OVER 30 SCHOOLS and only got into ONE. And another who applied to 14 and got in nowhere. They had to take a gap year. Strategy is paramount. A bad strategy will lead to bad outcomes, and we see bad outcomes a lot on this sub.\n\nThe only two things that are technically better: Ivies actually offer good fin-aid now, if you can get in, if you are \"middle class and below\" and their threshold for \"middle class\" is actually quite high. Also government Parent Plus loans now exist for all the crippling debt that needs to be taken on; Sallie Mae is no longer the only option for ruining your life (and PP loans are better than private).\n\nMoney is the #1. Figure out the money FIRST as it informs your entire strategy. Do you have any money saved for his college? What's your income level and will you qualify for any aid from California schools? If you either have the means to full pay and/or get good fin-aid from UCs, they're often the best option. None of them are safeties, really; look to CSUs for that. Definitely research/visit a few UCs and particularly CSUs so your son has a few solid options he actually likes.\n\nPrivates can often cost less than even in-state California tuition, depending, and many schools will offer competitive aid/merit to attractive candidates to lure them. But you have to be competitive, of course. And it's not the T-20s/Ivies who do competitive merit. But if you're high income and he's high achieving, a competitive merit strategy is possible/often advisable.\n\nIf you have money to burn? Hire a college counselor junior year. But know that they are spendy (money better spent on actual college tuition, imo). You should join College Confidential for free support/to ask questions/learn the ropes; it's a good place for parents (and of course many lurk here).\n\nFigure out the money and work on the college strategy literally starting now. Your timing is perfect. You have to balance money + GPA + test scores + ECs, as well as writing ability. This summer is the time for SAT/ACT prep--courses/private tutoring if you can afford it. Essays and supplements matter, though I loathe the new UC style--they're too short, mostly only academically or EC focused, in such a way most students write boring, by-rote answers and it's difficult to stand out. It's easier to show off personality and possibly dazzle with a strong overall package with privates/Common App.\n\nIf he's not a strong writer? Invest in an essay-specific consultant by the end of junior year (not too late). Be careful with who you hire. Lots of literal college students have companies, and then many more are astronomically expensive, but this sub is a good resource to find decent ones, if you go the pay route. Also don't accept situations where they write essays for a student and/or heavily edit. Though that's just my ethics talking lol. (but also I think college admissions essays written by adults are easy to spot, and not as good.)\n\nYou may have the urge to help with his essays yourself, and/or to let his senior year English teacher handle it. Don't. Parents and English teachers are often the worst possible arbiters of what makes a good college admissions essay. (not all English teachers disclaimer here lol) It's not a point paper; it's personal memoir. It should be specific, interesting, and actually sound like your son/a teenager. There are LOTS of \"no no NO don't do that\" topics--look up resources and listen to experts. Spring/Summer junior year is the time to start on the main Common App essay. And, re: heavy parental involvement... often parental interference leads to a less genuine, more boring essay from the student (not to mention cases where students can't write a real essay b/c what they want to write contains private information they don't want their parents to know). It's best to have him take responsibility for his personal essay and not hover too much.\n\nHonestly: this whole process works best if it's the student themselves who takes initiative, with gentle guidance and support from parents, imo. It's part of growing up/finding your path/having agency in your own future. Figure out the money and give him a realistic budget, and let him do a lot of this digging.\n\nAnd just watch out for his mental health if he's prone to anxiety/is a high achiever/goes to one of those high schools where people lose their minds over college admissions? This whole process is rough, and the pressure kids put on themselves (or is put on them) is ridiculous. Be gentle, supportive, and HONEST about the money. That's the number one. A true nightmare for a student is when parents are dishonest about the budget or delusional about college cost/magical scholarships and they end up with a bombshell in April (\"I won't pay that for college!\") and it feels like their future is ruined.

ALL extracurricular activities should be related to the intended major in the most specific way possible, trying to think about the impact that those EC activities are having on others and how you\u2019re making the world a better place. Do internships or jobs related to the major they intend to apply for in the highest profile place possible. Visit the campus like it\u2019s a job interview and make sure your child\u2019s name is listed in the book, have your child\u2019s be the one to communicate with the admissions office directly.

Some background on me and my situation:\n\nI had begun to apply to a select few universities back in the fall with the hope of being able to attend solely by paying out of pocket. I am a high school senior, top 10%, 4.0 gpa, 1310 sat, with a host of extracurriculars. Not extraordinary by any means, but a bit above average. I will be graduating this month with both my high school and associates degrees. \n\nBack then, Louisiana Tech was my top choice. They have a good cybersecurity program and are fairly cheap. Fast forward to November and I began crunching the numbers. I wouldn\u2019t be able to even afford that. I plan on going into the Air Force and was going to do the ROTC route. I had applied to the AF Academy, received a congressional interview, but ultimately was denied. I made the decision to enlist and attend college on the GI bill afterwards. \n\nFast forward again to last month. I recieve an email from the AFROTC HSSP. I had applied back in November with no real hopes at receiving the scholarship. It\u2019s the Type 1 HSSP scholarship, which includes 100% tuition/fees, a yearly textbook stipend, and monthly living stipend to any university that has an AFROTC program. For reference, nearly all universities have this program or some sort of cross town agreement with another university. \n\nThis notification struck me at a bad time, as I had to start looking for schools all over again. I set my mind on UCF shortly after. My main reasons for wanting to attend UCF have to do with their computer engineering program, the location (very important), and the overall atmosphere of the school. I hadn\u2019t applied last fall when I was seeking colleges out because I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the out-of-state tuition. \n\nEverything for my application was submitted before the 5/1 deadline\u2026 aside from my SAT scores, which were sent to the school yesterday and are still listed as processing in the application portal. I have been emailing admissions over the course of the past week, asking if they would still review my application and consider it. The admissions counselor said they can\u2019t guarantee I will receive a decision. I also called admissions and they said they had received the scores and they should be put in the portal soon.\n\nI\u2019m really stressing about this, as I know I could get into the college if I had only applied earlier.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Big rant incoming\n\nTo start off, I got into both Georgia Tech and the Honors College at UGA. I liked both colleges a lot but I didn't really know what career path I wanted to go down, so I delayed the decision until the last minute. Obviously Georgia Tech is miles better for engineering but UGA is good for pre-med and non STEM related majors.\n\nGeorgia Tech seemed a little intimidating to me at first, it's one of the best engineering colleges in the nation. It has the better career pathways and options but it's known to be really tough obviously. I know I either wanted to do engineering or pre-med, and u can certainly do both at Tech, but pre-med will be more difficult there. So I wan't sure if I was prepared for the grind at Tech. People told me that I'd be able to handle the Tech grind, but I was scared tbh. I didn't want to go to Tech and tank my GPA, cuz if I wanted to go to med school that would look bad.\n\nSo on deadline day, for some reason I just decided to commit to UGA. I don't know why, but I thought my work and social life would be more balanced there, and plus my brother already goes there, so I would have him to help me out. So yea, I basically decided to commit to the pre-med route then and there. But after some thinking, I regret my decision. In hindsight, I don't really like medicine. My parents pushed me towards medicine my whole life so I had this mindset that I'd just end up doing medicine anyways. Plus, I just wanted the wealth that came with being a doctor tbh. But I'm genuinely not ready for the hardowork and 10-year grind that comes with being a doctor now.\n\nNow thinking about it, I'd much rather be a CS engineer over a doctor. I'm genuinley interested in technology, idk why I didn't realize that earlier. But now it's too late. If I wanted a CS major, I shouldve definitely gone to Georgia Tech. And yes I've heard getting a CS major at Tech is really hard, but it only takes 4 years and I think I'd genuinely want to work towards that goal. But now I'm stuck at UGA, currently on a pre-med route. I don't know whether my parents would let me transfer to Tech later on, at this point I think they just want me to stick to the pre-med route for now. But I feel like I won't like studying medicine at all. I could later change my major to CS at UGA, but CS is better at Tech by far and I feel like I wasted that chance. I discussed with my parents tho, and they said I could major in CS at UGA if I really wanted to, and then go get a master's in CS at Tech for post-grad. And ik that the work-social life balance is probably better at UGA, but I wouldn't mind dedicating 4 years to become a CS engineer out of Tech, it would be worth it imo.\n\nBut still, I feel like I threw away a golden opportunity. I should have taken the risk and have gone to Georgia Tech, I think I could've explored more careers there and be more satisfied there. Plus, I think I'm capable of keeping up with the grind at Tech, i shouldn't have underestimated myself. And I think I'd much rather do engineering over medicine now. But idk I regret it so much now. Ever since I committed, I can't stop thinking about how I might have made the wrong decision. And like I said, idk if my parents are too keen on the idea of me transferring to Tech, I think they'd rather me stay at UGA.\n\nRant over.\n\nSo yea, anyone else regret choosing the college they chose? \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**TLDR; Got into Georgia Tech and Honors College at UGA, chose UGA cuz I thought I'd do pre-med.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "\u2026so I\u2019m hoping for some emotional support hugs.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a first-gen, intl, mature student with little money nor family support. I worked straight out of high school and got into an art school shortly before the pandemic erupted, so I couldn\u2019t attend in the end. \n\n(TW: suicide, abuse. I just want to unburden myself a little bit, so skip the next 3 paras if needed)\n\nThose two years were simply devastated to me, because at some point a friend of mine committed suicide. At another point, I was starving from food shortage. Meanwhile, I was also working in an art-related, youth-led org. It was very demanding in terms of workload, commute, and attending fee, since we often met in coffeeshops.\n\nWhat helped me carrying on was liberal arts courses I found online. I felt liberated from constant vigilance when I learned. Since I grew up in an emotionally draining household, joining discourses about improving systemic failures and other people\u2019s life helped me feel belonged and hopeful. And\u2026 normal. \n\nAs the last sentence implied, I was conscious that something was wrong with me. I often heard, or sometimes deduced from psych reports, that only a certain kind of unscathed, emotionally mature, socially smart people made it to and in college. And because those who went through traumas often struggle with interpersonal connections, it\u2019s unlikely they will make it. For those reason, when I applied for a mature student program, I felt the need to concealed more challenging parts of my (adult) life. By doing so, I wished to appear, idk, like a hero with a hard past, instead of someone who went in and out of therapy during the whole application process.\n\nFast forward, I got rejected from schools I applied via the CommonApp portal, but Soka (SUA). This is the school where I felt my essays were the strongest and had highest hope for. They first waitlisted me, but I got off their waitlist after scoring 1420 on my March SAT and supplementing my art portfolio. In the end, they gave me a full deduction on my tuition there, plus an 8k merit for my first year. Well, Soka turned out to have poor academic reputation and cult allegations. I tried to defend it, but the more I talked to its alumni, the more they confirmed its rumors. \n\nNow I\u2019m just lost, honestly. I asked the mature student program for an early likely/unlikely letter, to which they replied \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d. I wonder if it could be because I avoided mentioning past traumas when I wrote their essays, which decontextualized my personal growth (or maybe I couldn\u2019t show any  in there at all). Or maybe I chose a program that prioritized other demographics. I don\u2019t know. \n\nRight now, to quote the butler in Kazuo\u2019s The Remains of the Days, I see my future stretched out emptily before me. I\u2019m already drained from fighting generational trauma and systemic failures.

Consider factors such as location, size, and cost when choosing colleges.\n\nPrepare for standardized tests: Take the SAT or ACT at least once during your junior year, and retake the test if necessary to improve your score. Consider taking subject tests as well if the colleges you are applying to require them.\n\nBuild a strong academic record: Take challenging courses and aim for good grades throughout high school. Colleges will look at your transcript to see if you can handle college-level coursework.\n\nGet involved in extracurricular activities: Participate in activities that interest you and demonstrate your leadership, teamwork, and community involvement. This will show colleges that you are a well-rounded student.\nWrite a compelling personal statement: Use the essay portion of your application to showcase your personality, experiences, and goals. Be authentic and use specific examples to support your ideas.\n\nRequest letters of recommendation: Ask teachers, coaches, or mentors who know you well to write letters of recommendation that highlight your strengths and achievements.\n\nSubmit your application: Complete and submit your application by the deadline, ensuring that you have provided all required information and supporting documents.\n\nFollow up: Check your application status regularly and follow up with the college if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nAccept an offer: Once you receive an acceptance letter, carefully review the financial aid package and make a decision based on the cost, academic program, and campus culture. Submit your enrollment deposit by the deadline to secure your spot in the incoming class.\nRemember, the college admissions process can be challenging and stressful, but it is also an opportunity to showcase your talents, skills, and personality to colleges.

Firstly, faculty sometimes has a say in admissions, and this can vary from school to school. Sometimes admissions allows for faculty to read apps. I'm only going to speak to a good handful of the top 20s. AOs can send applications to faculty to read and evaluate academic promise. This happens during reading season. Happens sometimes, but only when an AO wants to send it to faculty because the AO also thinks this student has academic promise in a specific field and/or just wants to get an opinion from faculty because the AO can't speak to a certain field and how strong a student is. This becomes especially true when institutional priorities are involved relating to said field. When this does happen, this helps us determine the academic rating. The faculty member themselves do not make any real decisions here, just a recommendation.\n\nSecondly, a faculty member CAN potentially get someone off the waitlist. It's mostly an internal process, and it's somewhat rare. If a faculty member has read your app already (which you, the applicant, will never know) and sees that you're waitlisted/finds out, they can talk to the dean/directors/assistant directors to push you out into the admit pile because they really want to see you on campus. Sometimes a committee happens because of this, and then a student is taken off. Most often, committee decision is final and this added info won't help your case. The most important part here is that at the end of the day, it is still up to committee/AOs to decide this. Not the professors. If you are in contact with a current professor and they want to do research with you, then yeah, they can technically write a LOR and send it off to the admissions office. If you have REAL academic promise, and a faculty member hasn't already read your application because no one sent it to one internally, then you have a shot of getting off the waitlist. Sometimes, folks on the waitlist just need that one extra thing to help them push to the admit pile. However, I wouldn't recommend doing this unless you are absolutely certain this professor wants you on campus because your research potential and academic promise is high. And I need to stress here again that professors make no real decisions. They give recommendations and the committee decides.\n\nI'll end off with saying that these things are rare.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Hi, I'm a student from Turkey who originally committed to Bowdoin. I recently got off of Duke's waitlist and it's making me reconsider my decision. I'm interested in studying econ or polisci or possibly double majoring in the two. I'm not exactly certain tho and I plan on doing some exploring in university. Here are a few pros and cons of each school. I recieved similar financial offers so that isn't a concern. I have 5 days to make a decision so any feedback and guidance would be so so appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd \n\nBowdoin\n\npros:\n\n- campus environment is VERY friendly. I visited campus and everyone I interacted with was extremly welcoming and kind. Students seem to be very down to earth and smart. Seems like a wonderful community to be in.\n\n- class sizes are very small so it is easy to form close connections with professors. You get more individualized attention.\n\n-I prefer the location. Brunswick is a small charming town and it's very accessible to Portland and Boston. \n\n\ncons:\n\n- I'm afraid that the school might start to feel a little too small after a while. It has 1800 students and yes you get to form very close relationships with everyone but a larger school will allow you to form connections with more people. However, I could always go to a bigger school for grad and I can only have the small LAC experience for undergrad.\n\n- Class offerings and cocurricular opportunities may be a little limited. Because it is a small school there isn't as much variety in the classes and there is no Washington DC semester program.\n\n\n\nDuke\n\npros:\n\n- alumni network and brand name is very strong. Duke is very well known and well regarded across the board. It is nicknamed the Harvard of the South and it is slightly more prestigious compared to Bowdoin. This might be helpfull in internship and job searching.\n\n- My financial aid offer includes two funded summer study abroad programs or six-week summer classes on Duke's campus. While I will get the opportunity to study abroad at Bowdoin my financial aid offer will only allow me to utilize semester programs. Study abroad is something that I really want to do so this opportunity is a huge plus for me.\n\n- Co-curricular activities and more academic variety. Duke has its own Public Policy major which I am very interested in. There is a Duke Washington DC program that I would love to take part in. In general there is a lot more variety of classes to pick because it is a bigger school.\n\n\ncons\n\n- There seems to be a stereotype that Duke is a very white rich elitist institution, and greek life is quite a big part of campus culture which does not interest me in the slightest. There are all kinds of people though so I'm not sure how much it would affect my experience.\n\n- I'm kind of scared to be a small fish in a big pond. Duke is more of a competitive enviornment that can be cutthroat at times where as Bowdoin is more of an uplifting and welcoming community. As someone who is international I might benifit more from Bowdoin's small environment and more personalized attention.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "For a little bit of intro, I'm trying to major in biology on a possible pre-med track and I'm fairly academic but I don't consider myself to be the smartest person ever. All EC's related to biology. I am an OOS mixed student at every single one of these schools. I'm fairly certain bio is what I wat to do but I want to leave myself options in case I want to pursue another interest such as CS, Business, or Law as I am extremely indecisive sometimes. I want to ask if you were in my situation which school would you have picked. All of the schools were appealing to me and would have been the perfect match and they all have things I want like a sense of community, great locations, big time sports, tons of club opportunities, fun things to do off campus, and research. I have also already committed to one but I would not like to say which because they all were amazing and I found very few cons in each. I just want internet strangers to either validate my choice or send me into chaos if I picked wrong \ud83e\udd72 For context here is the info about each college's financial aid and personal fit:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBerkeley: Got to see it on Cal day and the students were amazing there. I received a little bit of aid from them but nothing too too crazy but with an external scholarship I have it makes it affordable. I believe there is some truth in the Berkeley effect but not entirely sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUSC: Got to visit on a travel stipend and everyone there was so passionate about their school spirit. They offered me very nice merit aid coming in to about half COA making it still affordable. I've heard about the Trojan Network but I'm not too sure if it's really legit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUCLA: I did not get to see UCLA on admitted students day but the campus is beautiful and the dining halls were amazing. Definitely the prettiest campus out of all of them. The vibes were similar to USC. They offered me about the same financial aid as Berkeley.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNorthwestern: Really was the only non Cali school I had in the running, so totally different location and feel. But visited on not the prettiest day but everyone there truly was so outreaching. The campus was the newest and I loved the architecture. They did not offer me as much aid as any of the other schools.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I know people say that you have to pick the one that felt right but tbh all of them felt right. So when I made my choice I wasn't 100% with it but it's all said and done so I can't change it, but I feel I couldn't really have gone wrong. They would all be affordable with smaller loans and I know they are all prestigious as well. But in my situation which one would you have picked to set yourself up for the best future and undergrad experience and why? Which do you think is the most prestigious and does it really make a difference in applying to grad school? Students and alumni from each school please comment as well if you had any nice experiences there that way if you are from the school I picked I want to hear about it. If you were an alumni would you have picked your same school if you could do it all over again or do you have any regrets?

I do not receive financial aid and asking parents to pay for more is not an option that would work/one that I am comfortable with. I am an only child and cost is not a burden on them at all.** \n\nMy parents pushed me to be here, long story short, but I don't want to go into law school with 80k in undergrad debt. Distance from home is not an issue at any of these schools. \n\nMy options are: University at Buffalo, Binghamton, Boston University, and staying at my current school.\n\nU at Buffalo: Would cost me 10k per year. Not a huge fan of the large/dual campus. Unsure of opportunities there, not a huge fan of Buffalo as a city but it may be fun to get to know it. Could probably graduate a year/semester early. Could probably come out debt-free. \n\nBinghamton U: Would cost me 8k per year. Got into school of management, ranked well! I know people here and they like it. Smaller campus. Haven't heard great things about the area. Could probably graduate a year/semester early. Atmosphere seems fun, I like a tight-knit feeling. Worried about making friends though. Could probably come out debt-free.\n\nBoston U: Would cost me 30k per year. I loveeeee Boston, I got into Questrom as well. This is seriously the only perk. I just need to laugh at it that they told me 90k per year. Ridiculous. I would appreciate some academic rigor though.\n\nCurrent University: Costs me 20k per year. Currently arguing with the financial aid department, but they also just raised tuition and dorming 6% each, likely to raise again in the coming years. Ranked around T70 (you can easily figure out what school haha). I enjoy the area a lot and have wonderful friends here. I'm sad to go! Program is fine but not super intense, leaving me pretty bored. Great area for internships and networking though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm between staying here and Binghamton the most. 80k is a lot for undergrad and I guess I just need some reassurance in that.

I saw in your comments that you're interested in CS, so I have a list of colleges that have a major in the intersection of art and CS. Most aren't T20s, but you can pick and choose as you like. They're also organized into my list of safeties/targets/reaches (lol I'm not applying to all of them), so that roughly ranks the colleges in terms of prestige. Here's the list:\n\nSAFETIES:\n\n1. Virginia Tech: HCI\n2. Purdue: Idk whatever Zhuyan did\n3. UIUC: B of Information Sciences, HCI\n4. Udub: Informatics, HCI OR Human-Centered Design OR Interactive Design\n5. Arizona State: Human Systems Engineering\n6. New Jersey Institute of Technology: HCI\n7. Rensselaer Polytechnic: BS in Design, Innovation, Society\n8. Santa Barbara University: Web design + Engineering (HCI)\n\nTARGETS:\n\n1. George WA University: Interaction Design\n2. Stony Brook: CS, HCI Specialization\n3. UCSD: Interdisc. Computing + Arts (HCI)\n4. Milwaukee School of Engineering: UX Design\n5. CCA: Interaction Design\n6. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical: BS Human Factors Psych\n7. UToronto: Information\n\nREACHES:\n\n1. CMU: HCI\n2. Stanford: HCI concentration, symbolic systems\n3. Tufts: Engineering Psychology\n4. Boston University: Vision and Graphics (HCI), CS Dep\n5. Columbia: Vision, Graphics, Interaction, Robotics Track, CS\n6. Cornell: Human-Centered Design\n7. Northwestern: CS, HCI in curriculum\n8. UIC: CS, Human Centered Design concentration\n9. Georgia Tech: Computational Media\n10. UMich: B of Information Sciences\n11. Duke: Computational Media\n12. Yale: Computing and the Arts\n\nFrom my experience, an interdisciplinary CS/art major usually is called either Computing and the Arts, Computational Media, Interactive Design, Product Design, UX Design, or HCI, or it can be a subcategory under CS or Information. Sometimes (but more rarely) it might be under Engineering or Psychology.\n\nIt's a huge pain to have to check through all majors that the art/CS one might be a subcategory in. I would recommend first doing a general Google search, then going through the list of majors manually. It's time-consuming, but a plain Google search often misses a lot of stuff.\n\nNote: Cambridge, CMU, and WashU also offer design majors (that include cs stuff) but they need a portfolio and that will be a huge part--if not the most important part--in your college apps.\n\nOf course, you can always design your own major or go to a pure fine arts school that may have a major relating to cs/art, but that's up to you. Some notable fine arts schools include RISD, Parsons, SAIC, SCAD, CCA, etc. There are many more that you can Google. I know for a fact that SCAD has a UX design major, not sure about the others though.\n\nI saw in your comments that you're also interested in pol sci, and I don't know of any majors that combine pol sci and art. You may have to double major or design your own major. If I were you, I would google either \"Good pol sci schools\" and from there, check if that college has a good program in art.\n\nIf you just want to do a double major in CS/pol sci and want a good art scene, you'll have to manually Google colleges that have good majors in both CS and pol sci and check their arts culture as well. As other comments have said, Yale is the obvious choice, but check out some other schools as well.\n\nGood luck!

I feel sort of ridiculous writing it \u2013 I haven\u2019t been on this sub in years. But although this is not the most well-thought-out message (it\u2019s finals and im tired) as a current Cornell senior who profoundly regrets my decision, I\u2019d like to help anyone else avoid my mistakes.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about it, don\u2019t come to Cornell. \n\nI say this as someone who put so much hope and time into college admissions \u2013 as someone who browsed this sub up and down, searching for the perfect answers. I never knew I could regret a college decision so much.\n\nSimply put, this school is not created to support students. \n\nThere is no inherent community. The school is siloed and decentralized, and no one in any part of it knows what the hell is going on anywhere else. There\u2019s no interconnection, and the administration is bloated and inaccessible beyond belief.\n\nDon\u2019t come to Cornell if you want a community or a place with school spirit. Don\u2019t come here if you lack a strong support system, or if you\u2019re introverted or have trouble putting yourself out there. You will be lonely. Most people here are to one degree or another; at the very least, most people go through a year or two of loneliness, even if they *eventually* find their place. They\u2019ll try to convince you that\u2019s normal. It\u2019s not.\n\nDon\u2019t come to Cornell if you\u2019re studying humanities and want an engaging intellectual environment, or if you\u2019re studying STEM and want a strong work-life balance. Don\u2019t come here if you care about making the world a better place: most people here don\u2019t. It\u2019s one big giant LinkedIn group, and everyone is just trying to network their way to the top\n\nDon\u2019t come to Cornell if you have even an inkling of mental health concerns. Truly. It\u2019s as bad as they say if not worse. \n\nDon\u2019t come to Cornell if you want to feel like you are cared about in your college environment. Everyone here is overworked and underpaid: faculty, staff, and students alike. I used to work as an admissions rep (lol) and had admissions officers explain to me how annoyed they were talking to prospective students and how their only goal with their job was \u201cyield.\u201d   \n\nUltimately, this institution can be a hell hole for almost anyone but especially for people without existing support networks or who happen not to find their friends quickly. No one here is looking out for you just for the sake of you being you; you have to scramble to get anything, from funding to friends to housing to classes. People will try to sell it as \u201cpreparation for real life\u201d but frankly \u2013 for the amount of money and effort that\u2019s put in to go here, you should get much more from an institution than this place offers. You can get \u201creal life\u201d for far less than $80,000 and change a year\n\nI acknowledge that my experience was uniquely unlucky and that many people have a good experience here \u2013 and I\u2019m sincerely glad they do \u2013 but it\u2019s not an institution that\u2019s designed to support students.

I've put in a lot of work towards my grades, but I'm near the end of my sophomore year and am only now seriously searching for ECs.  I have a few issues though. I had a very rough childhood, and I won't go into details, but I ended up missing around 3-4 years of schooling. Despite this I excel in science and English, but I am abysmal at math. I am 16 years old with 23 days of my sophomore year left, but I am only at a 6th grade math level. It's frankly pathetic. I have OCD and ADHD, so this also complicates things. I've been grinding in and out of school to improve my math skills, but I don't think I'm improving fast enough.  I take all of my classes in regular education, but I take math in the emotional support room (SPED shed, retard room, backroom, etc...) because of my lack of education in math. I've been doing pre-algebra for most of this year, and my ES teacher is just as inept at math as I am and just gives me worksheets instead of actually teaching me anything.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n I live in a very rural area called Austin PA. My school has around 200 people and has literally no extracurriculars aside from a handful of sports and Honor Societies. Finding a tutor around here seems impossible, and my school doesn't even offer AP classes. I feel like building an impressive resume is almost impossible out here. Sorry for the pity party, but what I'm really trying to ask is how can I improve my math skills to meet my grade level within a reasonable amount of time? Would it be possible to score an 800 on the SATs by the time I reach my senior year despite my tom-foolery? What do I do for ECs despite my situation? Do I have any chance of attending an Ivy League school or am I doomed to my safeties? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance.", "title": "I am severely behind in math, and I have little to no access to AP classes or extra-curriculars.

It covers Algebra I, Algebra II, and Geometry.

What about the transition to a more independent life? Are you willing to do it in such an isolated place as Ithaca? Not everyone can or wants to. \n\nEveryone has their own story, I get it. So I\u2019ll be open to questions in the comments as well as PMs since I got nothing but free time with 1 final this last final season.

RD starts after the EA round and varies by school with deadlines, for example some schools still have open applications while other RD deadlines like davidson are in early January. Personally I started the common app maybe late August-early September, its pretty easy to fill out, maybe an afternoon at most. I applied to 3 schools EA and about 30 RD. Apply EA to maximize scholarships and at selective schools they get most of their students from the early round. Fil out the fafsa as soon as possible once it opens, like October. Send it to all your schools. Some might require you to fill out the css profile which is basiclly fafsa but not from the government. For that just fill it out before the schools fiancial aid forms deadline. This can either be found on their website or most just don't have them I think. Send them once you've been accepted and filled them out. The css profile requires both parents tax info so if you can't get that from one and you don't live with them you can request and fill out a noncustodual parent waiver. A lot of it is school specific, especially in terms of institutional schoalrships, I've had deadlines range from November 15th to January 20th for my EA schools for scholarship programs. Some schoalrship programs can only be accessed if you apply early I belive. \n\nFor now narrow down a balanced college list, specifically include safeties where you can get in, you'd be happy to go, and you will likely be able to afford it, a school you can get into but can't afford or you hate it is not a saftey. General rule of thumb is public colleges are cheaper but won't give you much in terms of aid while private colleges are insanely expensive but give out aid much more readily  and sometimes have competitive full ride schoalrship programs that could be worth a shot. Do Not Procrastinate on your essays. If you don't have much essay experience write the less important essays first which sounds counter intuitive but you get better at writing the more you do it. Send the trash essays to your back up back up back up school not your dream school ya know. Request recomendation letters either at the end of this school year or the 3rd or so week of next year. Tell them the deadline is 2 weeks before it actually is, for example if the deadline is November 1st tell them you need the letter in early October. This is so if they forget you can politely remind them with 2 weeks to spare in case they start being difficult or overly forgetful. Tell them when you ask that you will send an email with the schools you'll be applying to, I made a document with my acedemin info, ecs, stuff like that, so they had something to base the letter off of, that part is optional but not a bad idea as it could get you a more personalised letter. Mention the 2 week early deadline in the email. Ask in person, they're less likely to forget. I made a spreadsheet to keep track of college stuff. I'm currently reworking the template but once it's done I can send it to you if you'd like and if I can remember. Hoenslty just ask about any specific part of the process that confuses you and I'll gladly awnser. I procrastinated on my essays by researching the college application process so I know a good amount I'd say, good luck", "score": 5, "author": "books3597"}, {"id": "jiiaixg", "body": "What I\u2019ve learned through this process:\n\nYou can find out EA dates by reviewing each school\u2019s websites. That info may not be avail for next year yet. But assume some as early as August before senior year starts therefore get letters of recommendation now before school is out of session. Or at least a commitment to get them by 8/1. Not all teachers will be open to this (or they will be confused by this) if you are at a less competitive school. But EA is so worth it for higher acceptance rate, and in some cases, housing priority is given by application date/time, by acceptance date, etc. \n\nGoogle when common app opens next year. I heard the main essay prompt is the same so can get started on the essay asap over the summer. Once common app opens you can see the supp apps, if any, for each school. Some only require just the one main essay.\n\nOn that note, google and keep an eye out for when common app opens this August. \n\nHave a copy of your official transcript handy if you have to apply EA before the high school is open in the fall. My daughter emailed it to the admissions officer. Then it was sent officially through Naviance, by the school, once they reopened. My daughter did the same with reference letters until they could be officially sent via Naviance. She could have waited for the school to reopen, but housing priority was by day/time of application for one school so she didn\u2019t want to wait.\n\nAs you apply to schools remember to send test scores via College Board if you elect to. Some require to receive by the EA deadline. Others only require it after you submit by a certain date.\n\nIf you are a candidate, I\u2019d highly recommend applying to honors colleges. Google for each school to see criteria. Some are auto accept, others you have to apply separately. My daughter ended up accepting at a school she didn\u2019t believe she would receive merit. So didn\u2019t do the separate honors app (a lot of extra essays). Then she received merit after the deadline. She can apply her freshman year if she decides it\u2019s worth it. Huge benefit is early registration for classes and more desirable dorms.\n\nGoogle when FAFSA (financial aid) opens next year and do it the first day it opens as I\u2019ve heard first come, first served. \n\nResearch how housing priority is given at each school. Some base it in day/time apply. We had to pay a few housing registrations while still making a decision where to enroll. It is critical to do this as soon as it opens. And eat the cost even if you choose another school. Housing selection is the hunger games. Having an earlier selection time is gold.\n\nIn regards to scholarships, most schools do auto merit. But some will prompt you, via email, to apply for other scholarships after applying. I\u2019m not familiar with needs based money.\n\nI know nothing about ED and applying outside of common app.\n\nThis is a lot, sorry!

Deciding on a college is often the first decision that you'll make as an adult, and you should make the decision that you feel is best for you - not best for your family. That isn't always easy because we all have responsibilities to those around us, and sometimes those responsibilities conflict with what might be best for us individually. It's really important to learn to balance that, and I don't think anyone can make that decision for you (not those of us on reddit, and importantly, not your family either).\n\n>My family is threatening to disown me if I leave, and I'm not sure how I would get on without a support system but is it worth throwing out all these other opportunities?\n\nThere's a cruel paradox here. A family that would stop supporting you isn't supporting you to begin with. But that said, if practically, you need your family to help pay tuition, it can be an impossibly difficult situation to navigate if that goes away. In that case, yes, go to your cheap and local option and get the college degree that will let you make enough to not rely on family that makes their support contingent.\n\n>My family insist CSULB will be the same as a UC but I am also the first in my family to go to college so I'm not sure if they're right.\n\nYes and no. Schools aren't better or worse than one another, but they are different. Your family is correct that the classroom education you receive will be the same no matter where you go. CSULB is one of the best teaching universities in the country, and you may, in fact, get a better and more personalized education there than at any UC. What will be different is all of the out of classroom experiences. Places like Davis, San Diego, or especially Berkeley, have huge resources that open up doors to new kinds of experiences that help students grow as people and professionals. CSULB will have that to a degree too - it's part of college - but the UCs will have more variety in the kinds of experiences and more support to help you seek them out.\n\n>What school do you think I should go to given everything? My mom insists not to worry about tuition she just wants me to go somewhere good.\n\nIf your mom is committed to supporting you, then you should go where **you** want. Nothing you've shared makes it clear to me what would benefit you the most between these schools - they're all great in their own way. You should think about things like small (LB) vs large school (Davis, SD, Berkeley), urban (SD, Berkeley, LB) vs rural/suburban (Davis), and how close you want to be with your faculty (LB will have easier access to faculty). \n\nThat said, while, I am actually a BIG fan of CSULB (Go Beach!), and I love and know both Davis and San Diego well, I would probably pick Berkeley if I were in your shoes.

So, I wouldn't recommend just \"stacking\" as many extracurriculars as you can - pursue what you're actually passionate in, and try to go as far as you can.

Look online for internships/experiences/opportunities you're interested in, or begin working on personal projects (what do you personally want to do, that will demonstrate skills like leadership or whatever else colleges like to see?). Try advancing or getting farther in whatever you decided to do. Everyone can do extracurriculars, but not everyone becomes really good/passionate for an extracurricular. Don't do something just because it will look good on a college application, because that means a lot of other people are probably doing it too.

I got accepted to UCSB, UCR, UCSD but the ONE school I was hoping to get into waitlisted me \ud83d\ude2d Well I\u2019m not officially on the waitlist as I haven\u2019t submitted my interest to be on the waitlist because I have to write an essay and add grades for the winter and spring semesters. The reason why I haven\u2019t done so yet is because I have a few questions which is why I\u2019m writing this post to get some insight. First thing is about grades, so unfortunately I got a NP on a communications course which isn\u2019t required for my major nor for UC schools but I am retaking it this semester just because I want to show that I passed (won\u2019t know till semester finishes). Also, I made the dumb decision to take way too many units and ended up dropping 2 courses out of the 6 that I was taking, one of which is a class for my major but I\u2019m also taking 1 other course relating to my major that satisfies the requirements. For my major UCLA requires completion of 2 courses out of 5 for my major but I know the more the better. With that being said, I am curious to know how do both of these things affect my chances getting off the waitlist? I also was curious to know what are some of the things I should write in my LOCI? I won\u2019t know whether I get in or not for a while but SIR are due soon and I\u2019m not sure which college to commit to because UCLA has been my dream school for the longest.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Hi everyone, transfer decisions for the college I applied to were made this past Friday. I opted to remain on the waitlist, and sent a LOCI to my admissions counselor/dean 3 hours after decisions came out. I\u2019m new to the anxiety of applying to colleges, as I spent 3 years at a CC, got my associate\u2019s, and then got guaranteed transfer admission to a state school that\u2019s not too selective (the college I\u2019m applying to transfer to is a good bit more selective than the school I\u2019m currently at). Because of this, I have a few questions:\n\n- does the admissions counselor/dean you email your LOCI to usually respond? (Last year I was offered a spot for an internship I applied to, and when I sent an email accepting the offer (from the same email he sent it to and that I used for my LOCI) I ended up calling and the PI said he never got my email because it went to his junk mail? So worried there haha)\n\n- I searched the school\u2019s website/blog/faq and they are open to LOCIs but don\u2019t mention anything about sending LOR after being waitlisted. I wasn\u2019t able to have any LOR submitted because a lot happened since I submitted my application, and was hospitalized for a week, and it just ended up not happening. If it helps my chances, I would like to see if I could still have one sent in, but don\u2019t want to send them unwelcome materials. \n\n- If I end up not being accepted off of the waitlist, I\u2019m unsure of what to do. This is my second time applying to transfer, and I don\u2019t want to do it for a third time. The other college I applied to I\u2019m not nearly as passionate about attending. I didn\u2019t apply to more because I wanted to stay closer to home, and am unable to stay at my current school because it is too far to commute from, and I\u2019m surrounded by a lot of things that trigger panic attacks for me. \n\nThank y\u2019all in advance for the help, and to fellow waitlisted students, I hope y\u2019all get accepted to your dream school.

At the ages of 18-22, practically everyone \u2014not just your girlfriend\u2014 benefits a lot from exercising independence from their parents. It sucks to have to pay living expenses, sure!

Because if they are paying for even a decent portion of it that would give them significantly more control over her especially if she goes to Irvine because they could just refuse to pay for her dorm or refuse to cosign on a loan to pay for the dorm then she'd be screwed, overall Irvine gives them too much control over her and too much acsess to her if things go wrong.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Hi A2C residents,\n\nWell, some of you. For those of you with a fistful of amazing acceptances, this doesn't apply. Go outside and celebrate. But for those of you dealt a shitty hand, one you didn't like, or one that was empty, this goes out to you.\n\nFirst off, crying is ok. Just make sure to drink water afterward, as dehydration should be avoided for health reasons. Second, if you want to scream in rage at the unfairness of the American higher education system, please do, because it isn't fair. Your hard work and your teenage years have been squandered in the vain hope of pleasing these uncaring gods, and all for it to be tossed aside after a set of arbitrary standards that no rational being could accurately describe.\n\nA year ago, I was in your shoes. I had spent my high school years slaving away in college dual-enrollment courses (in STEM too, mind you), doing all of the extracurriculars, and losing sleep in the vain hope that I too would be able to open a confetti-filled alert that read \"Dear DarkMoon, we are pleased to offer you admission\" and post it on my Insta like all my friends had done. I checked each portal every day for several months, itching for that joyful moment when all my hard work paid off, and my ascent to the next stage of life would begin in a shower of glory. However, that didn't happen.\n\nInstead, I got a whopping zero (0) acceptances. None, nada, naught, zilch, void, absolute bupkis. And I near about died. I couldn't sleep, barely talked, was a zombie for two months, and a simple corpse for another two. What made it worse was that I was still in those community college courses, and finals were coming. I barely felt a thing. I was numb to the world. I felt like my life had been blasted with a sawn-off at point-blank range. It wasn't merely an educational delay: it was a denial of my work. It was a denial of me. It was a denial of the years of slaving away, lost sleep, crippling depression. It was a denial of the next stage of life, of that beautiful American college experience of growing up, moving out, making new friends, and starting life as a truly (semi) independent young adult that we were told from day one, reinforced in movies and tv and the rose-tinted recollections of our elders. I died a little inside. I'm from the Bay, and watching my friends and peers take off to enjoy those aforementioned exclusive pleasures of education and maturity, while I was left behind at a community college, was painful. I mean... everyone talks a great deal about how it's a great deal, but you can still see the look in their eyes going \"Wow... you must be some breed of stupid.\" Bearing that is humiliating.\n\nBut it gets better. Time does heal all wounds (unless they are infected, in which case you should seek medical attention), and over time, I came to accept my reality. Well, not like I had a choice, but I did get over it eventually. It gave me a fire, of that rage of denial, to thunder through community college so that I could transfer in one year. Maybe that's not healthy, but it felt right. I wanted OUT. I wanted GONE. I refused to let this denial of my fruit borne of sweat and tears keep me under. So I hooked a TAG to UCI, and I screamed through one more year at community college. I took a full STEM load each quarter, I tore through each class like a furious tornado, determined that I would pull, pummel, and blast my way to the top and get what I deserved. Again, maybe not healthy, but hey, you're only a dumb hormonal teenager once, so might as well use it to its fullest, eh?\n\nAnd lo, that fire did pay off, and the clouds did open and the sweat of mine brow did produce fruit (sour lemons). My TAG fulfilled, Irvine sent me an acceptance letter. And I was satisfied. But, I had sent out more than one application, and it turns out I'm not actually going to UC Irvine.\n\nI am ~~pleased~~ fucking ecstatic to announce that I am going to UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Class of '25. The celebration day finally came, though a year late. And, perhaps I am better for it. Perhaps I learned some shit, maybe I got some of that illusive maturity. Or maybe I'm the same psychopathic overachiever from the Bay with crippling insecurity. I'm not an objective judge, so I will decline a decisive conclusion.\n\nBut what does that mean for you, dear reader, who managed to read this far (thank you, by the way), what does it mean for you? What does that mean for you, in the depths of despair and fury and unfathomable sadness? Well, it means that, weirdly enough, alien as it may seem, there is hope! There is possibility! There is a light, there is a way, there is a path! There is a way to rise above the rejections, of the shame and anger! There is a ray of sunshine beaming through the darkness! Life goes on. There is a way forward, into a more beautiful tomorrow. You will rise above. You will make it. You are not defined by this. You are more. You will do more. Where you are right now, whether it be a B-tier four-year you that was low on your list or shunted to a community college like me, you will transfer to that beautiful next place. You will succeed. Those who doubt you can go eat shit and die. You are down, but you are not out.\n\n  \nSo go get em, champ. I don't know you, but I believe in you. It may hurt now, but it does get better.\n\nGo kick some ass. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd thanks for reading.", "title": "Years, Tears, Perspective, a Retrospective, Have a Little of Hope, Just Try and Cope", "id": "133i1lg", "score": 33, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/133i1lg/years_tears_perspective_a_retrospective_have_a/", "permalink": "/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/133i1lg/years_tears_perspective_a_retrospective_have_a/", "author": "DarkMoonWarrior", "comments": [{"id": "jib1s8c", "body": "Out Standing.

When boys are these weird mysterious creatures, you will not be able to recognize manipulation or other red flags, nor will you be able to tell when they are bullshitting you. \n2. When you are in a relationship but feel guilty about the relationship and especially about any act of physical intimacy, it's awful for everyone. You'll send hella mixed signals. Imagine, if you will, someone who breaks out crying or shuts down after physical intimacy that appeared to be entirely consensual. You'll know he did nothing wrong and you were all in and it's your own hang ups that kick in after--but he's going to feel like he assaulted you, and then he's going to be angry at himself and maybe you, because in a situation like that, it's pretty much impossible to believe the person saying \"no, when I run away crying after we make out, it has nothing to do with you\". Its' not fair to anyone to get into a relationship when your feelings about relationships are so complicated. This is even more so if it's a boy who is not from your culture, because he's just not going to understand and he's going to think you are lying or exaggerating your feelings.\n\nSo. Get some therapy. Find people from your culture who have negotiated this. Make friends that are boys and begin to see boys as just people (which they are). Give it a year. Then reassess.\n\nOne more thing: get some sex ed. Read about birth control and STDs and both reproductive systems. But sex ed is more than that: get comfortable with your own body--I'm old, and it was a huge deal here in the US in the 60s and 70s when they told women to get out a hand mirror and learn about themselves.

From what I can tell, she seems to be in a good position for WashU and Notre Dame. The three important indicators that you should also consider (given that you are domestic applicants) are:\n\n1) her relative performance compared to her school's past students (as long as she is in the outstanding group from her school she should have good chances), \n\n2) a track record that supports the notion that she wants to go to medical school, and \n\n3) a compelling story for how and why she became inspired to go into medicine (she would be writing her story in her application essays)\n\nIf you wanted to get a better idea, I'd look into new tools that use machine learning to see if they give you a better predictor.

Questionable. Some of these points have been made before but:\n1) The formula seems to be anchored on the overall acceptance rate. So when those rates are very low, the formula has a correspondingly low ceiling. For a place with a 5% acceptance rate, nobody will get rated at better than 25%. Conversely, if the acceptance rate is 85%, you will have a hard time knocking your chance down to 20%, regardless of your stats. This shows up most obviously at schools like Tulane and U of Miami where acceptance rates are really low relative to the stats of their enrollees. Stats that would put you in serious merit aid contention will still result in a <50% chance.\n2) They can't model what they don't have. So, for instance, you would have to assume that if you have a great essay your chances are better, and vice versa, but it's hard to say whether this is factored in assuming that your essays will be average relative to the whole applicant pool, or relative to applicants with similar stats. In other words, they really should be saying that your chance is somewhere between xx% and yy% depending on the things they can't model, and it is unclear whether their point estimate is just halfway between xx and yy, is actually xx or yy, or is closer to one than the other. So if what they mean is your chance is somewhere between 10% and 40% conditional on your essays, LOR, and interview, that may come out as 25%, or 15%, or 35% depending on how their model works.\n3) Everything seems to be additive. In the real world, I think some combinations are more important than the individual items. For instance, imagine someone with a 3.8 and 4 AP classes. Having a 3.8 with 8 APs would be better. Having a 4.0 with 4 APs would be better. But having a 4.0 with 8 APs should be way better. But it isn't according to the model. This partly explains why the ceiling is so low for selective schools. Also, because everything is additive, there are no deal breakers. At many schools, having a 2.5 UW gpa will keep you out no matter what your test scores are, but in a model like this, you would be much more likely to get in with a 36 than with a 26 on the ACT. \n4) the stats they use are for enrollees, not acceptances. Everybody does this, and it's a pet peeve of mine, but it really can mess with a formula like CV's. When schools report things like 75th percentile test scores (even prior to TO), those are not the 75th percentile of people admitted. Everyone says they are. They are not. They are the 75th percentile of the enrolled first years. For a school with a 15% yield rate, that is leaving out the test scores of the 85% of admits who chose to go somewhere else. So if a school admits 12 people, and each one has a different ACT score from 25-36, the 25-75 of admits is 27-34. If everyone who got a 29+ score went to some other school, the reported 25-75 would be 25-28. If you have a 29, the reported scores make you look like a rock star. Against the actual admits, you're below average. In general, low yield schools are going to look safer than they actually are.\n\nAt the end of the day, what you're likely to get out of a formula like this is an underestimate for low acceptance schools, an overestimate for high acceptance and/or low yield schools, an underestimate for balanced profiles or truly spiky profiles, an overestimate for red flag profiles, and a single estimate reflecting a range of unknowns, which could be quite wide.\n\nBut... that's still better than simple acceptance rates or gut feelings. Personally, I convert the probability given by CV to odds, assume that the true odds are somewhere between half and double the estimate, convert those values back to probabilities, and consider that the estimate range. Which sounds complicated but really isn't. If CV says 20%, that's 1:4 odds of getting in. Assume that means somewhere between 1:8 and 1:2. At 1:8, the probability is 11%, and at 1:2 it's 33%, so I look at CV's 20 and say 11-33. A 60% comes out as 43-75. I then look at a list as if it's the pessimistic estimate (are there still enough safeties?) AND the optimistic estimate (are some of these reaches possibly targets?).\n\nThat's still probably giving too much validity to CV, but it's nice to have something.", "score": 1, "author": "ApprehensiveLaugh573"}, {"id": "jibw0fn", "body": "i had what seems like the exact same stats and i got into brown. your essays hold a ton of weight & everything is so variable/subjective in admissions don\u2019t let online calculators determine anything", "score": 1, "author": "OutrageousFlan6651"}]}

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "So long story short, I'm an international student (Comp Engineering major) who had quite a lot of big dreams to study in the US, but after an absolutely terrible first term (barely passing) I knew that I was basically guaranteed to get rejected from most universities since the mid-year report gets sent to colleges, especially because I needed **fin-aid**. \n\nThus, despite having a 40/42 in IBDP junior year, good grades throughout my high school, a 1510 sat, and ECs that I worked day and night for, I decided to only apply in the early round this cycle and told myself that I'd apply next year once I have my final IBDP grades in(  if I get a 42 or above out of a 45), and the mid-terms no longer shadowing my application. Also, I'll definitely be doing my Masters in the US afterwards so idk how much of a difference that makes.\n\nIn the early round I got rejected from Rice, GAtech, and was accepted to Purdue and Drexel($45k scholarship Per annum). After discussing with my parents, it turns out we can only afford Drexel. \n\nNow I was **DEADSET on taking a gap year** in the case that my finals go well, but now I feel that taking a whole year off I might get dragged behind, get out of the habit of studying and you know the usual FOMO of not going to college this year. And now I'm thinking that I might as well go to Drexel this year, just so that I don't have to sit at home for a whole year (I keep telling myself that I'll keep busy, but I don't know if that will realistically pan out). Plus, I honestly don't think Drexel is a bad school, yeah it might not be the highest in rankings, but I've heard that it has a pretty good reputation for engineering, and that Co-op also adds a lot of advantages to a student's profile later on (not to mention a bit of extra income that will help my family pay for college). \n\nOn the other hand, the local state-government has launched a \"full ride\" scholarship for all students who wish to study abroad in a top 150 uni according to QS rankings (dumb ik), so If I take a gap year, I won't have to apply for financial aid in more competitive schools and will thus drastically improve my chances anyways. \n\nI just don't want to feel regret later in my life that I didn't use my \"full potential\", or that I \"settled\", I definitely don't feel like that now but IDK society and stuff. At this point, I'm just so done with this college application, high-school, 10/10 essays BS, I really just want to go to college and put my efforts where my passion for engineering lies.\n\nAt this point I'm really torn between making a decision, so any advice y'all provide will be invaluably helpful.

I\u2019ve been thinking and have pretty much narrowed down my decision to either Notre Dame or Hamilton; I\u2019ll write some of my pros and cons for each below, and anyone who knows about those schools, please tell me if I\u2019m overthinking something or if it\u2019s not as much of an issue as I\u2019m thinking.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m going into psychology/neuroscience with the goal of going into either graduate school or med school after undergrad and doing really in-depth research into cognitive psych\n\nNotre Dame: great alumni network, awesome community, fantastic professors and academics, good sports to watch, great study abroad program. The area leaves a lot to be desired, and is pretty far away from my family though, the cost is really high and would probably put a lot of strain on my parents (they\u2019re willing to pay, but I\u2019d feel really bad), the sports are D1 and I\u2019m a D2/3 at best cross country runner so I\u2019d probably have to stop running professionally, I also am very used to living alone as an only child and ND randomly assigns dorms so I\u2019m scared of getting stuck in a tight triple or quad (I\u2019d be fine with a double, of course)\n\nHamilton: amazing location, open curriculum is really nice, community is awesome, lots of opportunities to explore new interests and continue old ones, smaller college is a plus, I\u2019d be closer to family, much lower cost, lots of research opportunities due to the lack of a graduate program, also a good study abroad program, faculty and staff are super kind and open to helping students, but also the academic rigor is a lot less than ND, there\u2019s less name recognition and it\u2019d probably be a lot harder to get into a grad school I\u2019m interested in\n\nOverall, I feel much more comfortable at Hamilton, but Notre Dame will get me where I need to be academically.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "I work for a big well-known university and I interact with hundreds of millenials and Gen Z kids. New cohort every year. It is impossible to overlook or ignore the fact that a huge swath from this population lack basic coping mechanisms and resiliency. I would say about 1/3 of our students regularly miss deadlines without an explanation or concern, with no fear of penalty (academic standing, probationary measures, termination), and readily expect accommodations. Many of them seem incapable of basic norms of propriety. For instance, PhD students (age 21+) starting formal emails with, \"hey\" or \"hi\" as if we are all going to the pub after class.\n\nTo be clear, the following greetings are all fine: \"Hi Professor Smith\" or \"Hello Professor\" or \"Hello Steve (if the professor introduced himself by name)\" -- all of this is fine and dandy.  I personally smile when students write to me with \"Hi Steve\" because it shows they are comfortable enough to talk to me like an equal. However, here is an example of what I see instead:\n\n\"hi, i wasn't able to do my homework last night due to a bad cold i caught, im sorry but i will turn it in very soon, thanks\"\n\nor \"hey, sorry about missing class today, i had to help my family with something\"\n\nI'm no carping marm for \"Dear Sirs or Madams\" but even a \\[Hello NAME comma\\] would suffice.\n\nGetting into a good school is only a small part of the battle. What you do with your time while enrolled is so much more important than the name drop of an Ivy League. I have seen thousands of students through to graduation. Many do fine in their classes but nonetheless squandered their time focusing on all the wrong things. They did not show professionalism, initiative, drive. Grades do matter especially if you plan to pursue a career in academia (grad school, post-doc, faculty), but of equal or greater importance is whether or not you are conscientious: does your every day thinking take into account how you are perceived and how you can improve? do you exhibit clear values, commitment, respect? do you care about the people who are there to help you? the secretary, the program director, your advisor? do you even really acknowledge that they exist?\n\nLook for opportunities to take on projects under faculty supervision. Even if it's as simple as doing a research reading assignment and meeting only once per month to gather feedback and ask questions.   This can turn into an internship, research assistantship, teaching assistantship, letter of recommendation, co-authorship.\n\nThink beyond your petty grievances and study the moving parts! the big machine in which you are now a part. Are you there as grit and grime? or are you part of the legacy  to keep the flame of knowledge and self-edification glowing.\n\nI would share \"tricks\" to increase chances for admissions, but the really good ones never use the backdoor!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*This post is edited to clarify my point regarding email etiquette. I am \\*not\\* issuing any moral imperative. I do not think people \\*should\\* talk in any particular way. However, I am saying that common sense informs most of us to choose to collaborate with people who speak to us in a mature, respectful manner.  When professors choose to take on students as collaborators this directly impacts their publication timelines and their grant fund status (grant proposals include research assistant lines, the principal investigator has to outline the scope of work the student will do and the results are reported to close out time and effort reporting). Who faculty choose to work with has a real financial and reputational impact on the professor. My post is not about grammar and manners, folks. Faculty with federal funds and publications on the line are simply \\*NOT\\* going to work with the student who communicates like a child. Sorry that the truth is upsetting so many people but please try to imagine whether this student can write a grant proposal to NSF or a co-authorship publication to a national journal. If all the clues we have to make that assessment is a poorly written email and a generally immature attitude, the educated guess would be no, and we would choose the professional and cordial B-grade student over the sullen impertinent A+ student.\n\nWe do not go to school in order to graduate.

Then transferred to another university where I did not complete my degree.   \n\n\nRecently reached out for transcripts and both the technical school and second university are stating that I owe them money and are withholding my transcripts. The best explanation I have gotten so far is there was an adjustment to my financial aid after I left the [school](https://school.So). So I must repay the school the money they overpaid to me. How does ones financial aid package change a whole year later? In both cases, it was well into the next school year before this was determined.  \n\n\nWhat options do I have to resolve this? Can I demand the school show proof of this overpayment? Any legal recourse?", "title": "Financial Aid Games", "id": "13392xv", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13392xv/financial_aid_games/", "permalink": "/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/13392xv/financial_aid_games/", "author": "leahgames88", "comments": []}

I ended up visiting and loved it, I connected really well with the community there and for a minute it started to feel like a found a home. \n\nThen last night I get my financial aid offer and it was basically nothing. 5k in unsubsidized loans. I wasn't necessarily surprised. My family has a high income so my efc is high even though because of things like prior medical expenses have decimated our savings so the efc on the fafsa is misleading. Anyway I'm appealing but I'm not very hopeful. I know medical expenses are an extraordinary circumstances but the problem is we don't have the documents to support the claim bc they were 5+ years ago. \n\nSo worst case (and most likely) scenario, I have to take out a minimum of 75k in loans to attend UNC. My other option is UMD which I'm in state. UMD would only require 15k in loans and I liked it there too. I know UMD is objectively the better option. However, it's 30 min from my house and I always dreamed of getting a fresh start somewhere else.

Virginia Tech, maybe UMD, Rutgers, WPI, RIT, RPI. (Also consider Wentworth--their co-op programs are really cool and from what I've heard are really useful for getting a job after graduation.

Your cousins and younger neighbors now have both extra pressure and a new example of a path they can follow because you did the transfer route so successfully. And look at all the money you saved in CC. You are a wonderful daughter and have brought so much honor to the family.\n\n I think that sudden switch you are making from normal CC student to family academic superstar is taking them some time to get used to and they aren\u2019t handling it gracefully. It\u2019s both a happy and an uncomfortable thing when your realize your kids are becoming smarter and better educated than you are, and that feeling is even stronger for siblings and cousins. That\u2019s not your problem. You get out in that sunshine and celebrate yourself. \n\nEveryone knows how hard you have to work to get into Cal (and I\u2019m guessing a few other UCs accepted you as well). Random people in the airport who see you in Berkeley gear will know. People who read your resume for interviews will know. \n\nCongratulations!

I\u2019ll be real with you - it\u2019s pretty challenging school to go through. Like I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d have more fun at Irvine.  It was my impression that Cal will just basically throw transfers into classes taught more at a graduate level than normal undergrad and expect you to keep up. They even let undergrads teach classes because they know everyone is so smart and likely to go on to academic careers as professors. And by letting you in they\u2019ve shown they think you are that capable too. That campus is incredibly beautiful and the mountains behind are a wonderful place to hike (and cry) and get a whole new perspective on the Bay Area. Don\u2019t blindly choose it for the prestige but 2 years at Cal is an incredible experience and you\u2019ll come out so smart and strong and humble. \n\nGo visit with someone who will actually be supportive and make it a victory tour - you have earned it! Buy yourself a cool sweatshirt and really check out the housing situation because it\u2019s not as good at Berkeley as at UCSD or Irvine. Look at the actual courses you\u2019ll have to take and go talk to the people at the transfer center. Take the new transfer class they offer and attend some of their events. It\u2019s a great way to meet friends and jump start your extracurriculars on every campus. In fact I\u2019d stop by soon if you can and get some wisdom from the seniors taking graduation photos. \n\nYou\u2019ve made it to the Big League.

Her dad said, \u201cyou just want to go to college to prove you are better than us!\u201d And she said, \u201cI already know I\u2019m better than you!\u201d But she was very torn. In the end, she knew she needed to save herself first, or she would just be dragged down and spend her life mired in all of that negativity. It was the best decision she ever made. Her life has been rewarding and beautiful and the strength she built eventually made her a support for her family. Please don\u2019t let this guilt drag you down. Remember the hurt little girl you were and how much she needed someone to take care of her and put her first, and be that person for her now.

You can afford these nice things with just a bit of effort.\n\nAfter college, you can immediately start saving for a down payment on a house and for retirement. Say you're earning $60k per year out of college, and you want to buy a $300k house. Then, if you can live on $40k a year, you'll be able to save the $60k down payment in 3 years. At 25yo, you can have a house.\n\n$80k debt...\n\nDuring college, you either have no luxuries, or you go further into debt than you already are. Everything you earn from the part-time job should be going straight towards bills to minimize debt as much as possible. You can have luxuries, but that'll burden future you with more debt.\n\nAfter college, your top priority is paying back debt. Assume that you're still earning $60k a year living on $40k. At a 5% interest rate paying $20k a year, you'll be paying that back for 50 months, or about 4 years and 2 months. Plus, you'll have to pay over $8k in interest during that time above the $80k you took out in loans. So you'll have this financial burden until you're 26yo. Then it'll take 3 years of saving that same $20k to afford the down payment on a house. That'll mean that you'll be 29 by the time you can afford a down payment on a $300k house.\n\nSo this debt will cost you about 4 years and 2 months in your financial life. Could be more or less if any of my assumed factors are incorrect. You'll be less comfortable and more burdened for this whole period of time. This time will push back your time to own a house and may push back retirement (although higher mid and late career pay could make up for it). \n\nOf course, this doesn't take in all the factors. Maybe, at the expensive school, you'll be able to earn $10k more in early career pay. Maybe you get a raise after 2 years from $60k to $80k.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Hi all, \n\nSo... I graduated in 2017, and enrolled at SUNY Empire, New York State's online school, as a nonmatriculated student. I truly don't remember how things led to this, but I want to say a few weeks after starting, I just... stopped doing coursework. Didn't drop out, just stopped logging in. I didn't know what I really wanted to do in life, felt like a screw up, wasn't disciplined enough for online school, etc. It was a stupid decision on my part, but I was 18. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 24 now, graduating with my associate's degree and currently am in the process of transferring to undergrad programs for English with a 3.7 GPA. I genuinely forgot about my experience with SUNY Empire until today, when I set up all of my student portals for school admissions. All but one of the schools list my application as complete, pending a decision, except Pace University. Under the application checklist, they list that they're awaiting SUNY Empire's transcripts. Considering I applied through the Common App alongside a few other schools, never mentioned SUNY Empire in a single transcript/application, I'm assuming they did some sort of academic background check. Yay me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question: What are my options here? Can I call Empire and request it be wiped from my academic record? Can I call Pace and just be honest, and that I don't want to submit that transcript as it frankly feels irrelevant compared to the work I put into school once I finally made a decision?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's important to note that I did not use any of Empire's credits toward my associate's degree. I started from scratch. Never even sent my current college transcripts from Empire, just my high school transcripts since it's a community college. The community college from which I'm getting my associate's does not even know I enrolled in that school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance hopefully!", "title": "Advice Needed: Forgotten College Haunts Me", "id": "132huf3", "score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/132huf3/advice_needed_forgotten_college_haunts_me/", "permalink": "/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/132huf3/advice_needed_forgotten_college_haunts_me/", "author": "United-Display6705", "comments": []}

Most of my schools were T20's and are understandably super hard to get into regardless, but my parents kept telling me how my peers who had much better test scores, essays, and extracurricular activities and did get admitted these selected schools, shouldn't I feel bad about myself? I do, and I knew this was the time for me to wake up and work my a\\*\\* off for the next 2-3 years in undergrad.\n\nThen my parents asked about my academics and I told them I was doing well in everything except organic chemistry (I am taking college courses as a high school student, so I am enrolled in dual credit classes). They then started yelling at me and calling me somewhere along the lines of unacceptable, lazy, and how my medical career took a huge hit as all medical schools see my grades since these were college classes, regardless of me being in high school. They kept yelling at me and told me that all kids at my school are always expected to be admitted to T20's which is entirely not true, and not only did I end up at some \"sh\\*tty\" university but my GPA has taken a huge toll, I am on the brink of collapsing my goals.\n\nI've emphasized I will worker harder in real college, and I expressed my disapproval as I did not want to repeat the same conversation over and over again, and that made them even more mad. Like, could you please give me a break? Just let me enjoy my last weeks of high school before I must actually hit the ground running.\n\nI would appreciate all the support in the comments...I understand my parents are trying to show rapport, but it is tough dealing with these situations, especially if they make a huge deal over it and do not let you express your annoyance.", "title": "Asian Parents all over my case", "id": "132grfn", "score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/132grfn/asian_parents_all_over_my_case/", "permalink": "/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/132grfn/asian_parents_all_over_my_case/", "author": "FM_LiverpoolLad", "comments": [{"id": "ji57dv3", "body": "Your parents are not wrong.

{"subreddit": "ApplyingToCollege", "body": "Tl;Dr: 1. Can I get a job in theory focused CS? 2. In an applied math/CS theory job, would a CS degree be best or a math degree?\n\nHello everyone. I'm currently a sophomore in High School, and I want to decide or at least get an idea of what my major will be so I can better research colleges and so on. I've been considering CS, although I'd like a little bit of advice on CS programs on outlooks in general.\n\nSo to begin I guess, the most important factor in choosing a major is of course what you want to do.  My passion is definitely mathematics. I do math in my free time, read math research papers, etc. My dream job would be a math professor. But from what I've heard it can be really difficult to get a job as a professor, so my thought was to double major math with something a little more applicable.  \n\nMy other reason for wanting a double major is that I have a ton of topics that I really love, so it'll be hard as it is just to choose two majors, much less only math. I enjoy physics, chemistry, CS (more details coming), and even humanities like history and philosophy. So this leads into the question of which double major to pick. I am leaning towards CS because it is very applicable/many job opportunities, because I do really like CS theory, and because my all time favorite applied topic, AI, is CS heavy.\n\nThere's only one problem: I don't really like programing that much. I don't hate it, but to me it's like a 1:20 ratio of thinking how to solve the problem (fun) to actually writing out all the commands (boring). So my first question is, are there theory heavy CS jobs and college programs? Or would I just be a software engineer if I go for the CS route? I know there is academic research in CS, but IDK if that's the norm or the exception.\n\nMy other question is about some of the theory heavy/applied math jobs. I know that there at least exist math/theory research positions but IDK what qualification they would look for. Specifically, I am really interested in the math of neural networks and machine learning. Would employers in industry who are hiring for the more mathematical AI jobs look for a CS degree?", "title": "I like CS but not programming, should I go into CS?", "id": "131z01f", "score": 12, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/131z01f/i_like_cs_but_not_programming_should_i_go_into_cs/", "permalink": "/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/131z01f/i_like_cs_but_not_programming_should_i_go_into_cs/", "author": "LocalBlackHoleInTown", "comments": [{"id": "ji2kkeg", "body": "So you like cs, without the programming, just the theory?\n\nSo you like math?

If you want to pursue paths, like being a math professor or theory of AI researcher, that require a PhD, you can consider that path much later. \n\nDouble majors are generally very difficult to pull off, and it\u2019s much harder in impacted subjects like CS.
