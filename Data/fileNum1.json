Bear with me, as it\u2019s a string of words written through tears. \n\nThis morning around 8 am Big Boy crossed the rainbow bridge.  For the last 24 hours he was barely eating or drinking. Without going into graphic detail, I woke up at 6 am to him very sick.\nHe sat in my lap and had a calm moment before I called AVS (emergency vet) to let them know we were on our way. Once there they found him dehydrated, with low vitals, and an ultrasound showed a mass in his abdomen. Please know if I thought it was right or fair to put him through any further poking or prodding I would have. \n\nHe was calm and loved right to the very end. He was not alone. He left his body with words of love in his ears and tender chin scratches. \n\nShare your pictures. Share your stories. Heal from the loss by sharing how much he meant in this community. \n\nIf you feel so inclined to donate in his memory, ASAP Animal Shelter Assistance Program has a special donations fund for senior cats called the Alexandra Fund. I will be doing so on January 17th in honor of Big Boy and Betty.  They both gave us so much joy, I couldn\u2019t think of a better time. (Be sure to direct it to the old guys and gals. Senior cats are special earth angels.)\n\nI could say a million more things about how special Big Boy was, and how much his company meant to me over the years, but especially the last two. For now I will just be heartbroken. And extend my deepest gratitude and many thanks to everyone for all the support you provided over these super-senior years.\n\nRest In Peace Big Boy, the UCSB campus cat. \nYou did good buddy. \n~2005 - 1.12.22\"", "score": 192, "author": "lostdiscoball"}, {"id": "hsey60f", "body": "Dude lived 17+ years.

Its about a childish privileged group of radical students being selfish and making the genuinely disadvantaged even worse off for their own incremental gain. The grads just don't have plurality support anymore, and that makes them the enemy in this situation. The second they started hurting undergrads is the second that they lost this entire fight. This strike was only ever going to work if they had the support of the undergrads because it's the only group of people that can actually legitimize it.

Genuinely, I'm not trying to discredit that. If it was organized, that is too far. But nonetheless, I think this is a struggle that is bigger than one midterm. It's about access to education for lower income communities, and the fact that people are being threatened deportation by the very people who live in nice ass homes with a bunch of free time on their hands to not be worrying about how fucking hyperspeed crazy time seems to be moving all the time for us hustling over here. And those peoples kids are set and their grandkids are set, everything lowest on the hierarchy of means is satisfied for them (and they have power to do that for a lot of people). There are people struggling daily with mental health issues, disabilities, food insecurity, and just the struggle of getting up and keeping going every day to generate profits for others who value it so little. These are all issues that are brought on as babies or later in life as children for some people. It has come from generations of pushing through the next day of work just trying to save enough to get some room to breathe. The grads are privileged. that is what gives them the free time to say \"Hey! This shit's fucked\" for those who don't have it. This is a fight we should all recognize that is not against any one group. It's against this grind we have been born into against our will under capitalism and it's about saying that this is not natural. This didn't happen before society (not sure what happened there to be honest). A job is literally something that makes money and profits someone. It is foundational in society to prepare a child for a job through every step in their educational development. It is congruent with emotional, physical, and mental development. It is not natural to train  children have no concept of anything whatsoever to work a job that, in the end, only exists because someone with enough money made it to make more money and privatized every other means of living. \n\nIt's not about a COLA at this point. It hasn't been since a request for negotiation was met with policing and threats of deportation (Would also like to mention that none of this would have happened if they would have been allowed a civil conversation). And hopefully it can be bigger than our bubble here. It's already UC wide. Did you know the UC is the single biggest employer in the state? I think it's pretty fucked they don't pay enough for education to be affordable under their own employment standards and rather, it is essential to supplement your income with a second job or parental support (which a lot don't have). It's about standards of living and equal access to all no matter what hand your were dealt at birth. \n\nI also think the COLA itself is a bit much to ask, I'm not sure if the UC can do it, just literally, financially. It is unacceptable that they don't but it may be a federal or administrative issue at that point. But this is the most we can do, hopefully make some noise that can't be ignored.

It's really been crushing my mental health and I've considered dropping the course even with a W.\n\nI've heard she was a really good professor and she definitely knows her coursework well, but she is difficult to understand at times. The TAs try to make up for this by making lectures be online videos with captions, but even that is questionable at times. One lecture video she announces that the answer to a problem was B and the caption said D meaning the TAs couldn't even tell and then people in the course discord were all confused on what she said. It's just one small case, but just goes to show it's an issue.\n\nPersonally I struggle with the homework the most. I don't understand why it's so difficult for me because I don't see too many people complain about it on the discord, except for a few people. I'm seriously questioning if it was a problem with myself or with the class. The problems typically ask questions that aren't necessarily taught in the ZyBooks because the ZyBooks are pretty surface level and sometimes the method to solve the questions are pulled from the in-lecture activity, but I feel like whatever we're given in the course material just isn't enough. It feels like the questions are meant to be taught through an instructor or LA to teach you how to intuitively think outside the box, not struggle with on your own. It's possible if you go to LA for every question you might have, but sometimes that's difficult if your schedule is busy and doesn't line up. I am truly appreciative of how many lab hours and office hours are offered in this course though, but it feels like a necessity to pass the class for me.\n\nThankfully I like other parts of the course which in generous in the points they give like completing zybooks and lecture video quizes. The midterms aren't as difficult either because they're meant to be a step down from the in-lecture activities, but personally due to how to course is structured I feel like I'm missing more practice in the fundamentals rather than niche cases that I have to look back to the in-lecture activity or lab hours for. The idea is to get the student to really understand the course material on the deep level, but I feel like the course structure or class isn't set up to do a great job at that with the questions and lecture material there is.\n\nAs for Nicolau's comment, it is completely unacceptable. I hope he gets the appropriate discipline and their attempt to cover it up as a \"typo\" is **embarrassing**.

The TL;DR is that the issue might be due to a confluence of the pandemic and the way one of the lines in your email may have been misread (tone-wise). \n\nI\u2019m not in ICS, but as a grad TA in another department, I have been absolutely appalled by how some (not all!) students treat us now when it comes to grading. I get a flood of emails complaining any time I give someone less than a perfect grade on something \u2014 even emails for things like not giving someone who didn\u2019t speak participation points (um, duh?), or refusing to accept an assignment two weeks after the deadline because a kid decided to \u201cfocus on other classes\u201d for a while. Every time, the response I get from students is basically, \u201cWell, I should get credit because I tried my best!\u201d Or something to that effect. (And I\u2019m saying this as someone who is a very lenient TA with deadlines and grading; trust me, if you have a real crisis or even just a bad mental health day, I give you extensions.) \n\nBasically, adjusting to post-pandemic life has simply not happened for a chunk of the student population. Most of you are wonderful and get me excited to teach each day; some of you seem to think that logging into Zoom for half the class should be an A, and deadlines are irrelevant.\n\nI say this because here\u2019s where I think your email went wrong (for me, at least): your complaint about homework. Up until that point, your criticisms were all valid (if true; I don\u2019t know the professor, but am taking what you say at face value). But then you go on this thing about being appalled that your homework is being graded on correctness. Not to be a jerk, but \u2026 how is that unfair? A degree is not (or at least, in my opinion, should not solely be) a participation trophy. Right answers do exist in the world and do matter. If you\u2019re coding my website, I care that you do it right, not just that you tried your best. Getting a degree in a subject certifies that you have mastered that content. Your professor has no obligation to give you full credit on homework if you are not demonstrating mastery of the content. *As a TA, I reward effort a lot in my grading, but it still matters that people also get stuff right.*\n\nSo all this is to say, I\u2019m sorry you got the response you did. I think your criticisms of that professor, if true, sound valid. I think it may have come across as entitled when you began to be concerned about not getting perfect grades on homework, and I think you need to understand that we (TAs, professors, etc.) are dealing with a ton of entitled people who are saying that to us on a daily basis, so you may have hit a nerve.", "score": 32, "author": "elosohormiguero"}, {"id": "ja97nb4", "body": "horrible response from the professor but your email skills def need some work as well", "score": 66, "author": "sushjens"}, {"id": "ja8u8wv", "body": "It\u2019s definitely unprofessional of them.

{"subreddit": "UCI", "body": "**TLDR: ASUCI students did not cancel Summerlands, the school\u2019s professional staff canceled it over fixable and preventable concerns. $200k and hundreds of student hours down the drain. No in-person concerts have been allowed to happen since February of 2020, which is a disgrace. We need an engaged student body that fights for genuine student control over the time/money we have devoted to UCI. If you are a student interested in taking further action please reach out to me and let\u2019s strategize; we need all the support we can get from you right now.**\n\nDear UCI Student Body,\n\nI am one of two ASUCI Concert Commissioners and I want you all to know the truth that **THE CANCELLATION OF SUMMERLANDS WAS COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE**, and why ASUCI professional staff and the structure of student government, not individual students or commissions, are to blame. This story is not intended to get tears and hugs from the students, but rather to give you all an accurate understanding of what really went on behind the scenes throughout this year-long ordeal. I hope that you all can channel your anger towards the UCI governance structure as we proceed with some sort of student measure to hold the administration accountable.\n\n**My Intro**\n\nI have wanted to join the ASUCI concert commission since freshman year of APAD and finally got the opportunity to become an intern last year. This year I was interviewed to become a co-commissioner/co-head for this branch, and have co-led it since last summer. I\u2019ve met incredible people like my co-head and commission interns who have taught me so much about building a strong work ethic, and I became more passionate about concerts as we put more time into planning them. Before this year, I felt a similar yearning for concerts to be better, especially during the first year of COVID, and I had believed that ASUCI was apathetic to student concerns when things went wrong. Unfortunately, I realized that while imperfect, the student leaders of ASUCI do not hold as much power in decision making at UCI as it may seem.\n\n**APAD - First Conflict**\n\nMy commission came into this fall incredibly excited about facilitating APAD for the student body, the first irl concert in two-years. We were going to help bring back the live music scene and help the student body connect with each other again. As you all know, the year started quite scary, with students coming back to campus infected and spikes in the virus happening around SoCal. APAD had been planned for Welcome Week, but the under the infuriatingly limited paramaters the school imposed upon us, we knew that the event would quickly turn into a super-spreader event. Despite the concert heads\u2019 pleads for social distancing and mask requirements, our VP at the time was unwilling to work with us to make the concert safe, suggesting that we cram upwards of 5,000 maskless students into one big crowd to intermix for multiple hours. After multiple exhausting fights with him and a not so supportive team of professional staff, they finally allowed us to postpone the concert to the beginning of Winter Quarter, so that it could happen in person. We then spent much of the fall quarter re-planning the entirety of the event. January rolled around and to everyone\u2019s surprise, a new spike in omicron cases caused Winter Quarter to be virtual for the first few weeks, forcing us to make APAD virtual. We were absolutely heartbroken by this situation imposed upon us, but we  tried to work within our restrictions to add some interactive components to the event, including meet n greet opportunities, q&a, etc. All of which seem simple but elements we had to fight hard for.\n\n**Racism and \u201cHouse 949\u201d**\n\nThere was supposed to be a NEW  concert slated for the middle of Winter Quarter dedicated solely to hip-hopcalled \u201cHouse 949.\u201d Our team poured a lot of effort into building this entire event out from scratch and were very excited to be putting this on for the student body. During this planning process just a few months before the event,  the full-time adult staff of ASUCI informed us they could not approve any of the artists we selected and cited racist reasons for doing so. Invoking how the Shocktoberfest floor-seat hopping incident was incited by a Black hip-hop artist (without recognizing how they limited floor-seats by a huge capacity compared to previous concerts), they used phrases that insinuated that the hip-hop genre brings a lot of trouble to our campus, how artists had to be approved through UCIPD, there was a longer vetting process for artists of this genre, and expressed disturbing concern for the types of crowds this genre of music  may bring. The list goes on. This debate was also happening around the time the Astroworld tragedy took place, which made it easy for administration to allege that all hip-hop concerts end up like this. At one point after fighting back, they had us write down two sentences per hip-hop artist to justify why they weren\u2019t \u201cproblematic.\u201d No matter what we did to fight back, they decided this concert wasn\u2019t going to happen because of \u201csafety.\u201d\n\n**Sabotage from our Student Services Vice President**\n\nFrom summer to winter quarter, we were also forced to endure [a corrupt and emotionally abusive ASUCI Student Services Vice President named Joshua Ma](https://www.newuniversity.org/2022/02/07/asuci-vice-president-of-student-services-joshua-ma-resigns/) who mismanaged the planning of successful events for everyone. He put us through a lot of hardship by being manipulative, power-hungry, disregarding and undermining our work, spreading rumors about other ASUCI members and attempting to pit us against each other, etc. He was also the reason a lot of our events were canceled or postponed, due to poor planning on his part. It was not uncommon that he would say he would do things, not do them, lie about doing them, and then force us to pick up his slack, forcing us to scramble. After the other commissioners in the student services office finally came together towards the end of fall quarter and recognized how unfit he was as our leader, we put together an internal review, demanding him to resign to enable an ASUCI SSVP responsible to the student body.\n\nDespite how damaging his leadership was to us, we continued to push forward to put together a good Summerlands for all of you, our last chance for an in-person concert before the end of the year. We worked diligently to ensure the success of this event for more than 5 long months. This concert was very restrictive in terms of budget, as Joshua had [siphoned $120,000 of the money from concert comission right before he left office](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/s0vj1h/article_on_asuci_election/hs4s6nv/). We were not thoroughly debriefed/educated on this transfer, and neither was the senate. We believe Joshua Ma had transferred this money in retaliation for us forcing him to resign. As Concerts Commission bore the brunt of his abuse, our testimonies were instrumental in removing him, thus why this retaliation would make sense. We hoped to use this fund towards Summerlands to secure more for the students or maybe even better artists but pro-staff believed this money that was allocated for the winter concert did not need to be put towards Summerlands because they said our budget already had enough money to accomplish a good concert. We did not want just a good concert, we wanted the best concert possible with all the funding possible to make up for the past virtual ones.\n\n**Summerlands Planning**\n\nDesite the limitations we for Summerlands, we incorporated new elements such as a 4 artist lineup, ASL interpreter, and new ADA-approved accommodations to make sure as many people as possible could enjoy it, whether they knew the artists or not. Finally, we had secured a very well known artist for the headliner (I can\u2019t expose their name due to NDA, but they are quite popular atm), only for them to drop out of the event two weeks before the event. By then, we unfortunately only had limited options to secure a headliner, a process that takes a couple of months. Throughout the entire time I was in this commission, we were never given information on artists\u2019 contracts or why they often sign them so late (days before the event) but we always had a feeling we were being deceived because we had seen other schools releasing line-ups much earlier than just a few days before the event.\n\n**SUMMERLANDS WAS NOT CANCELLED BY ASUCI STUDENTS**\n\nComing in to Summerlands yesterday: It was finally happening! we secured a new headliner and all contacts were finally signed.We were able to release the artist to the public a few days before the concert. Despite the thousands of negative comments from many of the students, we were relieved we would even be able to have an in-person concert again after the thousands of hurdles and limited budget.\n\nNervous but excited, we came to the venue on the morning of the event bright and early to set up, prepare goodies for attendees, add last-minute details in, etc. We quickly got alarming news from one of the pro-staff members that because of the drizzle of rain the night before, they were thinking of cancelling the event. I took it very lightly at first, thinking there would be no way a whole entire concert with [a little over $200,000 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18nR-rod3OZOzYOYjNgE1oQS2wdmCH2u3kAr0qSUWFuY/edit#gid=0) would be cancelled. Yes, the stage was absolutely soaked, and some of the stage equipment were damaged, but we assumed that ASUCI professional-staff (who are responsible for the stage logistics, and students are not allowed to participate in this process to hold them accountable even if we had tried) would take it upon themselves to force the external logistics vendor to figure out a solution by the show\u2019s start. We continued with our day trying to finish every possible detail of the event. At around 11 am that morning, my co-head and I got pulled into the office and informed that the show had been cancelled and we could do nothing about it. We froze in utter shock and fear\u2026\n\nAfter processing what we were hearing, we went to speak to one of the pro-staff members, who explained their completely illogical rationale to cancel the event. We pleaded with them, showing that the weather forecast showed no rain expected for the rest of the day at all. He looked me right in the eyes and informed me that the decision had already been made by the directors and that it was thesafest thing to do. After trying to argue back, I was on the verge of tears right in front of him while he told us we needed to draft an email to the school. My co-head and I left the room sobbing and feeling helpless. I called another staff member just to be told the same thing again, and the director who was the ultimate decision-maker was not in sight or reachable. Students were not consulted, only told the news after agents and everyone had already been contacted. The concert was cancelled without our consent.\n\nShortly after, professional staff attempted to force us to set up a booth outside to distribute merch to the students, something we did not have the mental capacity to do while sobbing and trying to process. My commission\u2019s year-long work, the $200,000 budget for the concert, and all of the UCI student\u2019s eager hopes were disregarded and thrown away by the professional staff in an instant because they didn\u2019t want to \u201crisk\u201d equipment getting damaged by the potential rain (which we knew wouldn\u2019t happen, and didn\u2019t happen). The worst part is that the professional staff could have just looked at the forecast a few weeks ago and ordered rain-proof equipment, but instead they cheaped-out and allowed for equipment that shorted out in the drizzle. They could have protected the stage from rain better. There are specific members on the ASUCI professional staff who have displayed an absolute inhumanity and self-service that has enabled the mistreatment of my commission, locked students out of critical decision-making, essentially lit hundreds of thousands of student fees on fire, and then in the end tell us the concert could not have happened due to some very limited liability concerns of equipment getting damaged in the rain.I am furious because this was unfair to every single one of us on campus and ABSOLUTELY PREVENTABLE.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt the end of the day, students are the face of this office to the rest of the school, but I wish more people knew what type of abuse of power goes on behind the scenes, and that professional staff actually run a majority of the show. The concert commission does get to help pick out artists, the amenities that students receive, the marketing direction, etc.; but the logistics and actual setup of the event is mostly managed by professional staff. I get 80 dollars deposited into my bank account every 2 weeks while working 15+ hours per week towards concerts, just to be given no choice in the final outcome. I understand student frustration, but it is very reactionary for students to continue to blame commissioners for a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d without recognizing we don\u2019t have control over many processes at UCI, Summerland\u2019s cancellation included. **I hope this post clears it up for you all.** In order for students to actually get the events they deserve, we need more decision making power at ASUCI. There is nothing that morning that would have made us want to cancel an event we put our blood, sweat, and tears into for so many months had it not been the administration who forced us to do so. If we had more control over funding priorities, the show absolutely would\u2019ve went on. This was something taken away from all of us, and I hope students start to direct that blame on to the people who get bankrolled by our student tuition, do not care about following through with events, exploit their student workers, and turn around and put us on the face of it all to deflect the blame every year. Go ahead and talk to the ASUCI professional staff (there are some very wonderful people on the staff who tried their best, but the leadership is rotten), and you will see that they really do not care about us and always defer to the UCI leadership at the top.\n\n**Call to Action**\n\nI want to apologize for you all only getting this critical background now, but please remember that UCI has an oppressive governance structure that represses any sort of dissent against their self-serving rule. The students deserve so much more than a few dollars refund for no in-person concerts this year. Although the concerts commission is hurt by the avalanche of negative comments, we recognize that students\u2019 frustration has been misguidedly pointed at ASUCI students rather than the root cause of the problem, ASUCI professional staff. There are no hard feelings between us and students, hopefully you all can channel your anger towards UCI as we proceed with something to hold the administration accountable. I hope people finally understand the truth so we can take appropriate action, and I dream of building an engaged student body that pushes for actual student control over the time and money we pour into this campus. I call on the student body to push for some platform of radical demands that fundamentally changes the governance structure of ASUCI. **If you are a student interested in taking further action please reach out to me and let\u2019s strategize; we need all the support we can get from you right now.**\n\nIn Solidarity, Anika Tasnim, ASUCI Concerts Co-Comissioner\n\n[**My Instagram Post**](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd2b_YOumIH/)\n\nSide note:[ A fabricated post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/uusduq/from_within_asuci/) was made by a person pretending to be an ASUCI concert commissioner a few hours ago.

I hope to provide some history and context to the situation. \n\n**UCI Hates Lawsuits** \n\nUCI has a lot of ambition as a school and cares significantly to climb university rankings. This has caused Administration to care a lot about anything that can potentially negatively impact the reputation of UCI. This has caused the university to adopt many policies to avoid any potential lawsuits. What this means if anything has even a small potential to result in a lawsuit they will avoid it like the plague. For this reason, the administration kills anything that could lead to a lawsuit no matter how ridiculous it is. That little rain that fell on the equipment from the administration's standpoint the sheer potential of damage from it and the potential of anything going wrong with it was more than enough for the admin to kill it. In short, the admin rather kill a 200,000-dollar concert than face a lawsuit for millions and that can drag UCI's reputation through the mud.  Student enjoyment of a concert probably was not considered. If you wonder why UCI does anything the way they do it's probably because they recognized a potential lawsuit somewhere. \n\n**Prostaffs role** \n\nRegarding Prostaff I will not defend any racism expressed or coldness expressed they should be held fully accountable for that. Prostaff works more as enforcers of UCI Administration and practical management of ASUCI. What does this mean? They can offer advice on ASUCI-related things but as long as UCI admin and their legal team doesn't say no to things because of some policy somewhere their advice can be ignored. What this means is that if the admin or legal say no they act as the messenger of that regardless of how they feel.  \n\n**Prostaff and CRs**\n\nAs to specific members of prostaff and connections to College republicans at UCI I can confirm they are nonexististant. Few of the members of the college republicans actively worked against prostaff and I actually heard some of them express plans to try and remove them from their positions obviously that never happened. Prostaff had no power to stop them from many actions like I said before if ASUCI's actions do not conflict with policy they can not say no and their advice can be ignored. In CRs case they ignored prostaffs advice all the time. Many of CRs actions actually were stopped because it conflicted with policies such as the infrastructure acts. \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nLook UCI policies need to be reformed many of their policies are obstructing the student experience and the admin seems completely fine with that. I made this post just in case any students seeking to reform admin or their policy have some important context. Whether that happens or not or any reform happens I am pessimistic it will happen but I hope it does. \n\nTo the Concert commissioners, my deepest sympathies.

You need way more context surrounding hosting events across different universities to deem the restrictions faced at UCI unreasonable.\n\nI totally buy the rationale for cancelling the hip hop event especially surrounding the Astroworld incident.

You're making it a lot harder to contain the virus since a lot of Americans believe that the virus isn't something to worry about.\n\nWe need to start thinking about how infectious this disease is. For example, we could infect others around us, and this spread is exponential. That means that EVEN in the best case scenario where your \"less than 1,000 cases at the moment\" is true (which it isn't! Official numbers have it at 1,500 cases), then that 1,000 will grow exponentially.\n\nAlso, we still have to take into account a ton of different factors. The tests are extremely hard to obtain. If you have symptoms of the coronavirus, you still have to go through mountains to get a test. I believe you have to have a link to travelling outside the US and symptoms of the virus to have a CHANCE at getting one of these expensive tests. For whatever reason, the US is limiting testing, perhaps with the goal of \"if they're not tested positive we don't have to include them in our number of people infected.\"\n\nSince we're not testing as much as we could and should be, you can't believe any of the small numbers that they're giving us right now.\n\nSorry to disagree, but your preference over online/in-person classes is pretty selfish considering we might be endangering our elderly population alongside those with high blood pressure, asthma, etc. Furthermore, you should do some more research on this virus. Your professors are likely to be older, which may increase their risk of death from the virus. If not, then your fellow classmates that DO prefer in-person classes will be at risk of infecting even more people since asymptotic people can infect others.\n\nThere's a BIG reason why the entire world is having a crisis about it.

Yes, you read that correctly. It is completely impossible for me to move a question from one quiz to another in CANVAS. Caveat: it's possible if you pull questions from a \"Question Bank\", if you created one... which is great... but get this... if I have a question in a Quiz but not in the question bank... there is no way to copy it from the Quiz INTO a question bank!!!! So, if you're an instructor like me and you created the quizzes before you knew about CANVAS question banks... you're fucked. It's almost inconceivably stupid that CANVAS doesn't offer this functionality... but I've come to expect this kind of stupid shit from CANVAS. Sometimes I can't even edit a question after I've created it, even though there's an edit button (clicking the edit button often has no effect, whether in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox). I can't even cut-and-paste a question. The only way to move a question from one quiz to another (or put it into a question bank) is to manually create it in the other quiz and manually type the entire question again into the editor. So, yes, sometimes a question has a small error in it... but we can't fix it. Period. Because CANVAS fucking sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The truth is that, unless you intend to go to grad school, your grades don't matter anywhere near as much as you probably think. If you learn the material... great. Most employers won't ask to see your transcript, so long as you have the degree. So whether you got 5 or 6 out of 11 on the quiz doesn't matter in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When you complain to me about minor quibbles like the above, it eats away at my time so that it's hard for me to get to the important topics\u2014like students who work on Fridays and genuinely cannot take the quiz at the normal time on Friday and I have to arrange a different time for them. These students have a genuine worry--missing an entire quiz. Most other complains are trivial by comparison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So... bottom line... I'll go through the long list of emails in my but I may choose to ignore it even if your complain has some merit in an ideal world.

{"subreddit": "CSULA", "body": "I understand that you have a job to do. I understand that the job sucks.\n\nThat being said, if you are one of the people roaming the campus with clipboards trying to get me to sign something, you need to chill the fuck out. There are too many of you running around hounding students for signatures. I also see that some of you are getting more aggressive with it, so consider this a FAQs for all of you:\n\n**\"Are you registered to vote?\"**\n\nYes, I am registered to vote, but you will never know it, because I will lie to each and every one of you to get you out of my face. It's much easier than telling you \"No\" 5 times, which is usually what it takes.\n\n**\"I'm petitioning to [insert cause here] and I can really use your help!\"**\n\nOn the off-chance that you're able to string together enough words to make an intelligible pitch that doesn't sound like you're trying to sell me a car, I'm still not going to sign, because your entire strategy of soliciting students while they're eating/studying/relaxing is intrusive, aggressive, and borderline harassment. If your employer didn't set up a spot for you to chill and gather signatures from people who were interested enough to ask, go back to your employers and tell them to stop being cheap. And if they told you that it was okay to circle the eating areas like vultures, you're welcome to post the name of the organization that sent you, their contact info, and their lunch hours so I can spam them with that same bullshit.\n\n**\"Come on! It'll only take a minute!\"**\n\nFirst of all, it never takes a minute. I know this because as soon I agree to sign something, you're going to pull five more clipboards out of your ass for me to look at. Second, if the conversation ever gets to the point where a simple \"No\" isn't enough to get you to leave me alone, you've crossed a line. This post is already way too long for me to get into all the aggressive, inappropriate shit that some of you do to coerce people into signing your stuff, so I'll keep it simple: If I say no, it fucking means no. Walk. Away.\n\n**\"It's for a good cause!\"**\n\nIf I started a petition to ban all you fuckers from setting foot on campus, I could probably get more signatures in one week than all of you could get over an entire semester. Even if we pretend that it's more than just a job to you, harassment isn't supposed to be part of your agenda. In fact, it makes your agenda look weak. Go back to your people and find a better way.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\n* **If we say we don't want to sign your stuff, please leave us the fuck alone.** We put up with having to say it once. We shouldn't have to say it more than once.\n* **If we give you attitude, please leave us the fuck alone.** You're likely not the first person to approach us that day. Don't take it personally.\n* **If we look busy, please leave us the fuck alone.** Many of us are here to escape poverty. Your cause is the least of our concerns.\n\nThank you.", "title": "A message for petitioners on campus", "id": "uto5sm", "score": 43, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CSULA/comments/uto5sm/a_message_for_petitioners_on_campus/", "permalink": "/r/CSULA/comments/uto5sm/a_message_for_petitioners_on_campus/", "author": "PTBR", "comments": [{"id": "i9cnifo", "body": "I wonder if we could make a petition to get them off campus...", "score": 12, "author": "Hahanobraincells"}, {"id": "i9cv01u", "body": "I usually tell them I\u2019m Canadian and that gets them to leave me alone pretty quickly.

Some women think the \"automatic sensors\" will take care of the mess they left behind; akin to \"the help\" or \"the custodian\" will do the dirty work for me. That isn't feminism, that's a relic of the old guard. Also, if you associate cleanliness with political movements, then you clearly don't know what feminism means or you have an agenda.\n\nWhat we live in is a very individualist and capitalistic society which knows no bounds of gender or person; it only knows the \"ME\" in all of it. What do *I* get; what am *I* owed; that's not *my* problem; *I* don't have to touch or clean anything, *I'll* have the help do it. (If you hadn't heard, that's a form of privilege.) We don't \"collectively\" think of the others who will use the toilet after us; we only think of our discomfort in the process; and if we as individuals can get away with not doing something, we absolutely will. It's the most American of traits... *passing the buck.*\n\nSince women sit down 100% of the time and men sit approximately 30% of the time (possibly less depending on how you care for your body), men's toilets get less action.

Additionally, the high cost of the permit is already a burden, and receiving a ticket on top of that only adds to the financial strain. A warning system could serve as a deterrent to those who may be breaking the rules and also provide a sense of fairness to those who are trying to follow the rules.  \n\n\nYour argument implies that individuals who are breaking the rules should automatically be punished without any consideration for their circumstances or understanding of the rules. This approach assumes that everyone is aware of the rules and has the means to follow them, which may not always be the case. Furthermore, the idea that those who follow the rules are entitled to be \"protected\" from individuals who break the rules is flawed. A fair and just system should aim to educate and assist individuals in following the rules, not just penalize them without consideration. Additionally, the assumption that paying for a permit automatically means that one is \"working hard\" and aware of the rules is also flawed.
