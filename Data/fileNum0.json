Everyone has different expectations and the life they want to live. \n\nI think it comes down to attitude and mentality. Riverside has a lot to offer, but so many people are stuck on the \"negatives\" that are perpetuated by previous students, students who don't go to UCR, etc. Focus on the positive and be open minded, and you'll be surprise that riverside has a lot to offer. If you're stuck on the negative aspects, then will you harp on the negative aspects of life, job, career, etc? Now, I won't say riverside is better than other cities like LA, etc because it's not. It's not comparable, BUT that doesn't mean it's not a good place to come to. \n\nAlso, if you guys complain about homeless, then you really need to grow up. Do you think they want to be homeless? A lot of things probably went down that you didnt see and the fact you judge someone based on their appearance rather than themselves. It's just sad. Keep in mind, there's probably a bigger homeless population in a \"good\" city like LA. You can't tell me there arent any homeless there. \n\n**Pursuing a higher education isnt a right. It's a privilege that not all Americans have the ability to do so.** What's your primary goal in coming to UCR? Is it to purely to party and have a social life? Idk about everyone else, but for me, it was to get an education and everything that comes after is a bonus to me. I'd say for those who complain to really look inside yourself and ask why don't you like it at riverside? There's an underlying reason why you may not enjoy riverside as compared to others. The common theme among those who I talked to in the past that complained about UCR/riverside are usually the ones who didn't get into a \"better\" UC than UCR and are \"salty\" that they aren't at like UCLA, UCI, etc. \n\nHonestly, i had a blast at UCR.

I don't think they realize how privileged they are at all.\n\nI'm just a prospective transfer student atm, but I moved out to Riverside after high school because it was more affordable than San Diego. The homeless situation in Riverside is just as comparable to other major cities (except OC because we all know what they do to them there), but people who complain about homeless are ignorant. These are people that society have failed. And they exist everywhere.\n\nI think people fail to realize that UCR is such a great campus and the city isn't too bad either, but they can't see past University Ave.... which isn't even that bad imo.  At the same time though, you get Sycamore Canyon not too far away.. There's Round1 in Moreno Valley... Rancho Cucamonga has some decent shopping. There's awesome Mexican food (and that's coming from a San Diegan with TJ tacos right next door). Like omg I was so happy to find out there's a 2 Potrillos in my hometown Chula Vista too. Hands down my favorite place in the IE for tacos. There's Vietnamese, Filipino, Thai, even dimsum and Mokkoji now!!! Like it may not be the extensive variety of LA perhaps, but it's not a cultural wasteland for sure. I mean, the number of boba shops that is around campus??? That's more than what people in Chula Vista have wtf.\n\nI think some genuine complaints should mostly be about the fact that Riverside has plenty of \"food desert\" areas like around Highgrove, Grand Terrace, or Jurupa.  But I feel like that's just due to city planning around all the industrial zones... still a concern though. \n\nAnother thing is IE driving... which is like LA driving, but worse 'cause there's actually space to be an aggressive driver here lol. But then again, I come from SD where everyone drives like sheep \ud83d\ude43 ahem. But again, you get your different flavors of bad drivers everywhere in the world. Heck, I'm not completely innocent either haha.\n\nIn general, you need a car to get anywhere noteworthy here, but the same could be said in San Diego/LA as well. So, I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of it.\n\nIdk very discombobulated comment from me, sorry. I just feel like I have so much to say about this, I love Riverside so much.

I grew to see past that. And now, having been at UCR for the past four years or so, most of those original criticisms have disappeared. Riverside is a second home to me.\n\nI\u2019ve come to thoroughly enjoy what Riverside and the IE have to offer. The friends and connections I\u2019ve made down here are priceless. The memories I\u2019ve made with those people will forever be a part of my college journey.\n\nSome complaints are valid.\n\nYes, the air is smoggy and causes breathing problems. Yes, the water is hard and dries out skin. But those can be remedied with some research and purchasing a quality air purifier and water filter.\n\nYes, there is homelessness. Yes, there is crime. But honestly, issues like these are evident at every city in California and across the country, college town or otherwise.\n\nSome aren\u2019t.\n\nFor those that complain about \u201coh, it\u2019s too hot out here\u201d: we are literally in a desert.

Just be open-minded and willing to explore. Look into different modes of transport if Riverside isn\u2019t your cup of tea. Zipcars are an option: cheap membership and reasonable hourly rates (w/ gas included!) \n\nIf that\u2019s out of reach, public transit is an excellent alternative: RTA is free for UCR students, and the Metrolink is amazing if heading out towards LA (or anywhere in between)!\n\nIt does feel like some complaints mask what a student truly feels about the region and the people who call it home.

I am the only one in my family who has health insurance, and I pray every day none of them get sick or injured because we have no savings.

We are ready to fight even if that temporarily means we lose our wages. We are still doing what we can now for our students, but come Monday, we are dropping everything to go on strike.\n\n\u201cOur professors, both in coursework and who we TA for, have been really supportive, canceling our classes and urging our undergraduate students to support us.\n\n\u201cWe just want liveable wages so that we can be the best instructors/TAs and researchers. Constantly worrying about food and whether money will be enough for rent and praying to the high heavens no one in your family gets sick or injured is simply unacceptable, especially when you see your bosses and administrators living comfortably, and in the case of the chancellors, in luxury.

We've lost some really outstanding professors this way, including one who was literally given their own department to run at another university.

Routinely, only ONE of the psychology courses, either neuropsych or a different one would be offered, and then only offered in either the fall or spring semester, but not often both. Then, the psychology majors would have to contend with the cognitive science majors for whatever upper division course fulfilled the requirement. The reason only one psych course would be offered was because there was only one professor who taught that course. It's been a while since I was a student, but check out the UC Merced Classifieds group on Facebook.

You can't have everyone in a fear because it will both make things harder for the police, who will almost certainly be responding to a significant amount of false tips from people, (which can cause bigger issues such as when Reddit sent police on a wild goose chase after the Boston Bombing and the actual attacker killed someone else in the confusion), and that can make it easier for someone to slip through.

I was bored and I have morbid sense of curiosity.\n\nFirst off, this is the product of a psychotic break if I've ever seen one. \n\nSecond, It was kind of interesting to read, and I did manage to parse out a few main ideas among the jumble.\n\nDude is clearly upset with our society, especially regarding racism and oppression. A good 50% of what I read was focused on the topic of America's history of racism and slavery, with Harris suggesting a violent, genocidal type of black supremacy (but not all black people, only certain ones) as the answer. Its seriously crazy stuff. \n\nHowever, even among the paranoid delusions he manages to make some decent philosophical references, so he's clearly well educated. He even makes some understable criticisms of academics who spend their lives writing arcane papers on topics like oppression without ever actually helping the real people experiencing it in the very cities they live and work in (from there he concludes that academics are all actually racist themselves, or at the very least dont care, and they only write on those topics to pad their academic resumes and get grant money).\n\nUnfortunately, specific ideas such as these are the minority of the paper. The majority of it is a collection of extremely sexist, antisemitic, racist, and generally violent statements that often make little sense. The dude literally throws every racist or prejudiced slur you can imagine at basically all racial and cultural groups. It actually seems like he was going down a list, or trying to make one. And he often repeats the same word or phrase hundreds of times (in a row), seemingly attempting to emphasize. \n\nI did notice he often uses the exact same rhetoric against the groups he is attacking that he previously criticized white people (whom he calls \"the Unworthy\") for using against black people, so there might be some attempt at irony there. Or its just regular racism, who knows. \n\nHe also directly mentions the previous event that got him into trouble, apparently sexuality harassing a student.  He claims innocence and chalks it all up to racism. He then accuses the other philosophy faculty of racism and of throwing him under the bus. Then again, he also describes pretty clear rape fantasies and even describes *himself* as a pedophile. But, on the other hand, in other parts he lambasts people for calling him a rapist and pedophile so its unclear if he actually considers himself that or not. It doesn't make much sense.\n\nAll the rest was pointless jumble, and he just seems to be writing whatever pops into his head. Talks about everything from his taste in pornography to his opinion on modern architecture. There is no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nI worked with patients at a psychiatric hospital for a while and this dude sounds exactly like many of the patients there.

{"subreddit": "ucla", "body": "Hello UCLA students! A tip from someone who has been here for a while and lived in student housing and multiple apartments in the area. If you want your sanity intact after your stay here, do not rent with premier student housing! They really should be called shit housing for torturing unsuspecting students. I will tell you why. \n\nI moved into their levering avenue complex a few years ago. My first year there were some minor issues with the unit but nothing unbearable. I was rent controlled with them and I didn't need to worry about finding roommates, so it seemed great! Oh, except they don't vet roommates and it's a literal carousel of people in the summer. These people stay for a few weeks and often don't care about the space.  I thought, well, that's ok! It's still a good price and another year won't hurt. \n\nThe next year I noticed a humidity issue that led to mold starting to crop up. We cleaned, we really did but it kept coming back. We would get them to fix leaks we noticed and that our neighbors noticed, but it never really went away. I was a frog being slowly boiled yall. I was not prepared for the nightmare that was my third year there. Also the management is horribly unprofessional. \n\nThey started using a utility company that would charge us literally hundreds of dollars a month. Impossible amounts of utilities. Currently for the utilities we were required to pay for (water, gas, trash) I never pay over 100 dollars for a unit of a comparable size (honestly even that is more than I usually pay by a large margin....). They would send misspelled emails riddled with typos. Maintenance took forever even with emergency issues. The weird manager, who went by different names depending on who was talking to them, accused of sabotaging showings. Showings they would schedule and then show up for on different days, or without warning. \n\nI regularly spent days without a working toilet in that apartment. We had our bathtub fill with sewage (our downstairs neighbors did too!) They said we complained too much because it took them 12 + hours to come and start fixing it. There were multiple instances of construction in our unit. It was disgusting. And it turns out that the mold and humidity were from a long standing leak that I'm pretty sure was from deep issues with old pipes. In short, that place is contaminated with mold for sure. \n\nSave your sanity. Their other buildings are also old and poorly managed. If you like sewage and rude people this is the place for you though! I got really good at plunging toilets and now I'm not phased by bodily fluids. \n\nDid I mention they don't vet roommates and I once had to clean up vomit to use my own toilet? Yeah. \n\nIn short, fuck premier student housing. I hope their company fails \ud83e\udd70\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the awards and I am a little flabbergasted at how this all blew up. I am just glad that students are now aware of this predatory company and that students leasing with them can band together now.

You should talk to a tenant attorney, because this sounds like a fun case (do you have pictures or videos and copies of the communication?)\n\nSeriously, if anyone in this forum is dealing with shitty landlords, my advice to you is \n1. All communication should be in writing. Emails, texts, letters are all good. Verbal is not. This includes ANYONE associated with the building and maintenance of the property. Take names and contact info\n(Don\u2019t use their portals unless you\u2019re taking screen shots and logging the communication)\n\n2. Pictures, videos are perfect. Start a blog and log it all. Report violations to the city. Note any violations of the warranty of habitability to your landlord when requesting repairs\n\n3. You can always say \u201cin my personal opinion, this landlord is a slumlord \u201c that\u2019s not slander. That is an opinion. And bottom line: it\u2019s not slander if it\u2019s true\n \nI copied the bottom from a tenant attorney\u2019s website, but.. I\u2019ll just say that I\u2019m not an attorney but I\u2019ve been through this\n\u2014\u2014\n\nSummary of the Implied Warranty of Habitability\nWhether a California landlord knows this or not, they have the legal obligation to provide tenants with a livable place by the simple virtue of holding the premises out for rent. The implied warranty of habitability became law in the early 1970s and every state except Arkansas has incorporated this into their laws either by legislation or through court decisions.\n\n\nThis mandatory warranty covers basic and important things such as:\n\nRoof that keeps the weather out\nRegular access to hot water\nA working heater\nSturdy floors and walls\nAbsence of significant danger from toxins such as lead, asbestos, and mold\nAbsence of vermin or insects, such as rats, mice and cockroaches\nWhen a California landlord refuses to provide these basic requirements or fails to make repairs when necessary, the implied warranty of habitability has been breached. A tenant may have the right to sue the landlord in these situations\n\nSignificance of an Implied Warranty Breach\nIt is important to understand that the aforementioned list describes issues that are major and not minor. Of note, a defect is considered \u201cminor\u201d not because of the cost of repair but because it does not render the property uninhabitable. A \u201cmajor\u201d issue is one that makes the property unlivable.\n\nIn short, California\u2019s implied warranty of habitability requires a landlord to keep the premises in a condition fit for the occupation of human beings. Landlords must substantially comply with housing and building codes/standards that materially affect a tenant\u2019s safety and health. If your California landlord does not provide adequate heat or hot water regularly or fails to get rid of an insect infestation or rodent infestation, for example, then the implied warranty of habitability has been breached. On the other hand, if a tenant causes the unlivable, unclean, or unsafe condition by damaging the property, it is not the landlord\u2019s responsibility to repair fix any arising issues.\n\nHere\u2019s the attorney i copied it from\n\nhttps://www.hbklawyers.com/tenant-rights/uninhabitable-rental-units/breach-of-implied-warranty-of-habitability/\n\nHere are other guides \n\nhttps://caltenantlaw.com/HabitabilityChecklist2013.pdf\n\nhttps://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1941.1.", "score": 2, "author": "Ebbyisablackcat", "page_title": "Implied Warranty of Habitability Breach in Glendale | Haig B.

However, I think that a large part of our lack of voter participation stems from this sort of...anti-USAC culture that seems to percolate throughout the student body. People seem to immediately write off USAC as a joke, yet complain and gossip about the ongoing scandals which don\u2019t change much year to year. \n\nAt the end of the day, I do believe that USAC can have the power to affect GOOD change for students on campus (eg voting to fight any hikes in tuition or payments that they try to sneak on us like this, and much more). \n\nUltimately, it boils down to the need to recognize that we live in a bubble. Political engagement is very real and does happen at local levels. But it only happens when people care enough to vote. I remember in my APUSH class like 4 years ago, we discussed how the power of democracy start with people coming together to hold discussions and vote. Case in point: voting in elections and for regulations that affect our daily lives on campus. \n\nI think voting turnout will only change when people realize that there are those in office who do care about students, and we vote for good individuals to change the face of USAC/ political culture on campus, as well as hold them to a higher level of accountability. \n\nIf we don\u2019t do anything, then we are reflective of the greater political schemes going on right now in Washington. In the democratic process at any level, we are supposed to be voting for our representatives are we not? If we take no action and only the 8%(?) determine elections, by not voting, are we not electing our masters? People who make decisions for us that we may not like, may negatively affect us, and ultimately get away with their actions?  USAC has what, $2M that come from expensive student tuition? This money goes to our elected student offices in the form of stipends. You\u2019re paying them, so why not pay for someone who\u2019s going to invest in the Bruin community?\n\nAnyways, I\u2019m only as woke as the next undergrad lol, BUT if there\u2019s one thing to take away: VOTING IS IMPORTANT.

{"subreddit": "UCDavis", "body": "I posted on this sub a few days ago asking about the tallest building on campus.\n\nI was not trying to stargaze, throw parties, nor do anything fun.\n\nYes, I tried to jump off a building and end my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of you might have seen my personal story from my previous post (it has been deleted so I would appreciate if you do not share any personal details about me). I have been extremely struggling from academic, personal, family, financial struggles and many more without any access to a proper care. Out of years of depression, multiple suicide attempts, and desperation, I had no other choice as my life has been stuck on the very bottom of the ferris wheel ever since I was born or I can remember. It seemed like the world has turned their back on me.\n\nI packed all my belongings so it would be easier for others to clean up my room once I'm gone. I wanted to write letters before the end, but I did not have anyone to write to nor anyone who could write one for me. So that's when I wanted to share my story as a stranger to other strangers, hoping one of them might recognize my presence and the struggles that I had to endure. I just wanted something of mine to be left when I am gone. And I was ready finally. When I posted a question, I was not trying to gather attention. All I planned out was once I see the very first comment with the building name, I was planning on heading there, and the rest was very clear.\n\nBut people reached out to me. Some people who identified themselves as a fellow student, faculty, staff, and even a complete non-UCD affiliated stranger reached out to me. They offered me resources and heartwarming words. I was hesitant. But after reading all those messages and comments, I gave myself another chance telling myself that one day, my life will be better, and some day, I might reach the top of the ferris wheel happily looking down all my accomplishments after years of struggles.\n\nAlthough I am not fully recovered yet, I feel better for now. As the crisis counselor I met said, it is going to be a long journey, but what really matters is taking one step at a time: Give yourself a chance one day at a time and give others\u2014counselors, classmates, other people who are here to help\u2014a chance. So I did, and hopefully I will keep doing so.\n\nI just wanted to share this for those who were concerned or curious about my whereabouts, and I wanted to thank every one of you who reached out to me. Even though it is going to be a difficult and long journey, I will give myself a try. So if anyone who\u2019s reading this is in a similar situation, please give yourself a try too.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart everyone for saving my life.

A simple Google search of \"harvesting organs alive\" will yield many news articles from the media, yet almost all of these articles reference a story posted by China Tribunal, which again, is a FaLun Gong ran news agency, who absolutely hates the CCP and will do anything to destroy them (pro trump being one of their ways).  Now to me, this is clearly a propaganda that's aimed at the general public to harbor their hatred towards another nation.\n\nAnd let's not forget, that in 2006, the same story and accusation appeared, about FaLun gong practitioners organs being forcefully removed while being alive in China.  And mind you, the US department of state led in the investigation of these accusations, that they personally sent agents to China, and they found no evidence of any kind that supported these allegations. \n\n Now in 2019 I'd think with all of the information that's available to us, we at least will perform our own research into something so serious such as this, and be able to think critically for even a second, and draw a conclusion that is at least somewhat reasonable.  But then I see people here who ignorantly and willingly spread lies like this, simply because of an article that they read online mixed with the overall negative sentiment of China, that they took this story and ran with it.  I can't help but be a little disappointed by all of these posts, comments, or links  that could potentially plant a seed of hatred towards another nation and its people.", "score": 6, "author": "noworkrino"}, {"id": "f34xcuu", "body": "leave pro hong kong stickies on their hype mobiles", "score": 21, "author": "None"}, {"id": "f355jsr", "body": "I know what he is talking about.

I\u2019m going in as a political science major, but I actually spent most of my time in high school studying computer science until I realized I absolutely hated it. I took 3 weighted classes in sophomore year (AP Euro, honors chemistry, and honors principles of engineering), 4 APs in junior year (AP Computer Science Applications, AP Lang, AP Calc AB, and AP Chem), and 3 APs senior year (AP Gov, AP Microeconomics, and AP Statistics). I didn\u2019t do great in all my classes, so my GPA was 4.1. Advice I would give is:\n- highschool is your time to EXPLORE! Don\u2019t stick to a single subject unless you 100% know you want to specialize in it. Take classes that you think you\u2019d be interested or are curious about to find out what you like :)\n- Don\u2019t overload your plate, I learned this the hard way. I took a bunch of APs and honors (partially bc I was required to for an academy) bc my friends and most of my classmates were taking them and I didn\u2019t want to \u201cfall behind.\u201d It ended up damaging my GPA and I didn\u2019t really care abt the subjects that much. Take APs that you care abt and want to learn abt, not just the popular ones. \n- remember to get involved in extracurriculars and volunteering! It helps your application and makes for great memories and friends :)\n- UCs also look for personality! There\u2019s a page to list activities and achievements, your essays are meant to show your personal growth throughout highschool. Don\u2019t turn yourself into a robot that only functions to do work, focus on your personal growth too!\n\nI know you don\u2019t have this year in person, but really do try to make memories when you can. There are a lot of things I wish I did, but didn\u2019t since I was studying instead. Highschool is a time for YOU.

You should really focus on graduating college. What is your major again?\n\n>Evidence has emerged that SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can be transmitted airborne in aerosol particles as well as in larger droplets or by surface deposits. This minireview outlines the underlying aerosol science, making links to aerosol research in other disciplines. SARS-CoV-2 is emitted in aerosol form during normal breathing by both asymptomatic and symptomatic people, remaining viable with a half-life of up to about an hour during which air movement can carry it considerable distances, although it simultaneously disperses. The proportion of the droplet size distribution within the aerosol range depends on the sites of origin within the respiratory tract and on whether the distribution is presented on a number or volume basis. Evaporation and fragmentation reduce the size of the droplets, whereas coalescence increases the mean droplet size. Aerosol particles containing SARS-CoV-2 can also coalesce with pollution particulates, and infection rates correlate with pollution. The operation of ventilation systems in public buildings and transportation can create infection hazards via aerosols, but provides opportunities for reducing the risk of transmission in ways as simple as switching from recirculated to outside air. There are also opportunities to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in aerosol form with sunlight or UV lamps. The efficiency of masks for blocking aerosol transmission depends strongly on how well they fit. Research areas that urgently need further experimentation include the basis for variation in droplet size distribution and viral load, including droplets emitted by \u201csuperspreader\u201d individuals; the evolution of droplet sizes after emission, their interaction with pollutant aerosols and their dispersal by turbulence, which gives a different basis for social distancing.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719704/", "score": 0, "author": "redditsucks987432", "page_title": "Page not available - PMC"}, {"id": "ibxqxmx", "body": "Really not sure why I have to point this out, but...\n\nYes, covid is emitted (as both droplets and aerosols) *from the respiratory tract of an infected person.* A mister or similar device is not a biological organism that can be infected.

I would be very surprised if it outweighed the greatly decreased probability of covid transmission outdoors.\n\nAnd again, evaporative cooling is not the same as \"dousing a football field with water\", and aerosols are not the same as droplets.\n\nI won't use ad-hominem attacks like you did, though.

I got the bike back. The guy who punched the bike thief is a dope guy.\n\nSo this subreddit has been goin crazy over the guy who punched the bike thief. Well it was my bike, and I owe my life, first-born child, and kidneys to this man. There was no reason he had to do what he did, but he just decided to be the Good Samaritan I\u2019m sure we all want to be at some point in life.\n\nI won\u2019t disclose his name or the videographer\u2019s name, but I\u2019ll just say that they\u2019ve both been so amazing. I want to give him a reward but he\u2019s too nice to accept anything from me. So I\u2019ll just pay it forward in the future if I am ever in his situation.\n\nI was in class in WLH until 6:20, and this occurred just shortly before at 6:00. When I noticed my bike was gone, I was pretty shocked, but it really didn\u2019t feel real until I started walking to the trolley to go home. When I got to the trolley, I had a feeling I just needed to go back, and low and behold, the videographer just happened to be standing there (he wasn\u2019t there after class had ended). When I asked if he saw someone steal a bike, he showed me the video and I was in disbelief that someone would risk themselves for someone else\u2019s property. I walked right over to the campus police station and had my bike back in a few minutes after giving my statement.\n\nTruly incredible rollercoaster of emotions in 1 hour of time. If you ever have the chance to be a Good Samaritan, please take it, you may just save the day. Or someone\u2019s e-bike that they use daily.\n\nFrom now on, the bike stays with me in the classroom...\n\nNote that I got permission from both the puncher and the videographer to post this video.", "score": 719, "author": "andysoozma"}, {"id": "hxf6mzu", "body": "Absolute KING behavior", "score": 290, "author": "Isaiamerica"}, {"id": "hxf9qpg", "body": "I hope this guy goes down as a legend in UCSD history", "score": 183, "author": "apurvahp7"}, {"id": "hxf6d0j", "body": "Damn that was a nice punch!", "score": 169, "author": "alwayswonderinglibra"}, {"id": "hxfa49q", "body": "I'm glad that this had a good ending, but the fact that someone even attempted to steal a bike brazenly during the daytime with people watching is really concerning.

{"subreddit": "UCSD", "body": "Back when I was an undergrad at UCSD, the CRAZIEST thing happened to me. Here\u2019s the story\u2026\n\nI was living in an apartment with my girlfriend (at the time) doing my homework, when suddenly she tells me \u201cI found the answers to my chem midterm online and used them yesterday during it.\u201d I was speechless, she could tell I was having a hard time processing this so she walked into her room to give me space.\n\nDuring all this shock, I smelled something burning from another room and heard the apartment\u2019s fire alarm go off.\u201dWill! There\u2019s a fire! Help!\u201d I heard my girlfriend shout. Now I was stuck in a conundrum -- report her to the academic integrity office, or put out the fire in my apartment?\n\nIt was at that time, I remembered UCSD\u2019s famous focus on Academic Integrity, and I wanted to protect the culture of academic integrity in order to reinforce quality teaching and learning at UC San Diego.

{"subreddit": "UCSantaBarbara", "body": "A friend who knows about my horrible experience pointed me to an article about Munger trying to build another windowless dorm at UCSB.\n\nDon't live there. Ever. Here are my thoughts after living in UM's Munger building in Ann Arbor for a few years:\n\n1) The \"close spaces\" forming bonding experiences is mostly BS. It was basically a blind-roommate situation where people mostly kept to themselves. People end up getting mad at each other for the normal stuff - not cleaning, leaving a mess, making too much noise, etc. It doesn't make you bond any more than a regular dorm experience.\n\n2) HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE WINDOWS. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who has a weird sleep schedule anyways. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who was frequently nocturnal. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who enjoyed being alone anyways. I was so so so wrong. Going to bed and waking up in complete darkness everyday fucked with me so hard. After months of this I got to the point where I was snoozing for _3 hours_ and completely lacked the ability to get out of bed on some days. I didn't know when to get up or when to go to sleep and the days just started blurring together. I bought a sunrise alarm clock (one of those clocks that gradually brightens to simulate a sunrise). It didn't help. I made my alarms noisier and switched up the tones. It didn't help.\n\n3) They will try to win you over with nice furnishings and appliances and attractive \"living community\" spaces at an attractive price point. Don't be fooled. They are all very nice but if you are stuck in your bed, it won't matter. Also, the university jacked up rent far faster than inflation each year. I think inflation was around 2%/year when I was there but rates were going up 4-6% per year.\n\nThe architecture plan for The UCSB building looks even _worse_ than Michigan's. At UM, at least each \"suite\" of 6-7 rooms has a common area that has windows in it, so you can sit there to at least catch some daylight. The UCSB version looks like almost NONE of the suites _or_ rooms have access to windows.\n\n[This article](https://www.independent.com/2021/10/28/architect-resigns-in-protest-over-ucsb-mega-dorm/) states that\n\n> \u201cas the \u2018vision\u2019 of a single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.\u201d\n\nBut it has definitely been tested. It is just as horrible as you'd imagine.

I do agree with you that portray of black males in media does lead to worse race relations. I agree with this study. However, I don't think this study would agree with some of the comments you have previously made.\n\nTo put in summary: You said \"they're not oppressed, not even a little bit\" (I noticed you edited your comment so if this isn't your view anymore just let me know). Thus, I responded to you by saying that oppression does still exist to which you started arguing with me. If you had said \"Racism/Oppression is still bad but we are going in the right direction\" I would have never replied to your comment.\n\n**What this study is saying**: It is saying that oppression exists and is influenced by an incorrect portrayal of black men which is caused by the media. The media puts out false information that correlates black men with violence (not violence against black men). The conclusion is that black people are oppressed because of internalized racism that results from incorrect media portrayals and unconscious forms of racism (which has resulted from individual racism). Racism in society has thus has transformed from individual racism (hatred against blacks) to systemic racism. The media is bad because it spreads false information about black people, not because it misrepresents the severity of racism. The media fails to provide balanced perspectives of black men because when one sees black men on television they are typically playing a character that promotes racial stereotypes such as black men being violent or aggressive. It it is talking about how **stereotypes** that are falsely portrayed in media can lead to uninformed audiences who may form biased opinions based on this info.\n\nThe paragraph you cited is talking about the media spreading stereotypes of black men being aggressive (one among other stereotyped characteristics). It is saying media promotes racist and incorrect views of black men and this is extremely damaging to them. Thus, because of the misinformation of \"studies\" linking black men to poverty and violence, people have formed racist beliefs about black men. Its not saying that racism is distorted in the media- it is saying that the black men as people are distorted in the media because of stereotypes that have formed about them.  For example, black men commonly play thugs on television and this misrepresentation is what leads people to believe that black people are linked to violence. Nowhere does it state that the portrayal of violence **against** black men is damaging to them (If you disagree go look at the list under \"Causal link between media and public attitudes\"). It is the portrayal that black men **are** violent that is damaging. \n\nHere is another article that explains the study.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/media-misrepresents-black-men-effects-felt-real-world](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/12/media-misrepresents-black-men-effects-felt-real-world)\n\nOn a side note. Here are some valid points that the study made that I think are important moving forward.\n\nSaying racism is not as bad as it was is not a good solution:\n\n**\"One of the characteristics of the current period is the assertion that although racism may have been prevalent in the past, it is no longer a significant problem. In fact, asserting that white racism is the source of black people\u2019s problems is caricatured as not only excuse-mongering, but a form of  \u201creverse racism.\u201d (Schram, 2003)\"**\n\n\"**As Winant puts it, \u201ca refusal to engage in \u2018race thinking\u2019 amounts to a defense of the racial status quo, in which systemic racial inequality and . . . discrimination . . . are omnipresent\u201d**\n\nRacism is still omnipresent in society:\n\n**\"Most importantly, a rich set of studies, including cleverly designed psychology experiments (especially Implicit Association Tests), makes it clear that many if not most non-blacks have negative unconscious associations with black males, even if they have no consciously biased attitudes.\"**\n\n**\"More generally, scholars find that images in the media have a negative impact on black people\u2019s perceptions of self and of their communities, though there is no shared consensus on how exactly this plays out. Various mechanisms may be at play:**\n\n**XNegative stereotypes (thugs, criminals, fools, and other disadvantaged types) are demoralizing and reduce self-esteem and expectations.**\n\n**XThe most common \u201crole models\u201d depicted in media (e.g., rap stars or NBA players) present limited, often unrealistic, options.**\n\n**XMore positive or realistic role models tend to be lacking.\"**\n\n\"**If a person believes discrimination is largely a thing of the past, or  that discrimination is solely about interpersonal slights and personal  racism, or that success is due solely to personal pluck, a policy  conversation can seem irrelevant.**\"\n\nI think if you reworded what you said (because it seems like you were arguing this) I would have agreed with you!\n\nWhat I think you were trying to say :\n\n\"**We should find new and compelling ways to address causes, rather than focusing  solely on disparities, which can easily lead to counterproductive  conclusions about who is responsible.\"**", "score": 1, "author": "theimaginarysublime", "page_title": "Page Not Found | The Guardian"}]}
