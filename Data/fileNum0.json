{"subreddit": "ucmerced", "body": "Hey hope you all are having a great day.\n\nI'm stuck between UC Merced and UC Santa Cruz mainly because UC Merced is much cheaper. I got into UCM for Computer Science and Engineering and got into UCSC for Computer Science. I wanted to be a game developer but chose computer science to broaden my job opportunities and I know there are some issues with the game dev industry.\n\nSome pros I found for UCM are the student-to-faculty ratio, new facilities, the clubs, and the small population. But some cons are that the food and location suck. The food was on the news for how bad it was, but it seemed better when I visited. I don't plan on leaving campus much but I imagine the location makes it hard to find job opportunities. Their Computer Science also isn't ranked that high compared to the other UCs. As far as game development I saw that UCM has a game development club, game jams, and a course in game programming. UCM is also a growing school so it'll only get better.\n\nSome pros for UCSC are the close proximity to silicon valley for job opportunities, the beautiful campus, and the computer science is ranked a bit higher. Their game development program is also highly ranked. The cons I see are the cost and how hard it is to get housing. My friends are also going to UCM, two of which are doing the same major as me, while at UCSC I'd have no one. \n\nSo for UC Merced, what are the job opportunities like for Computer Science? Do the professors care a lot about your education and are the classes good quality? What's the best and worst thing about the campus?", "title": "UC Merced vs UC Santa Cruz for Compsci", "id": "133dnmo", "score": 7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/133dnmo/uc_merced_vs_uc_santa_cruz_for_compsci/", "permalink": "/r/ucmerced/comments/133dnmo/uc_merced_vs_uc_santa_cruz_for_compsci/", "comments": [{"id": "ji9hzau", "body": "I'm a UC Merced professor, not in CSE.

Most professors* at research universities are hired and promoted primarily based on our productivity as researchers.  That's also the case at UCM.  But!  In my experience the professors here care a lot more about teaching than at other research universities.  I'm constantly adjusting my classes each time I teach them, trying to help students understand difficult concepts and experimenting with classroom activities and assignments.  There's no class where I just show up and read off the same lecture slides yet again.  \n\n* There's a difference between professors and lecturers.  Your writing course and probably some other lower-division courses will be taught by lecturers, who are technically hired on contract to teach certain classes each semester.

UCM only has two core upper div classes and the rest are electives. So if you know you are interested in a certain field UCM is better because you can focus on those specific classes.

A lot of it depends on you esp in CSE, so unlike other majors your school specifically doesn't make much of a difference(this is one of the reasons I picked Merced over UIUC).    \n\n\nMost professors care a lot about your education but classes are not necessarily the most rigorous compared to other schools(im comparing in general not UCSC I don't know about how their classes are). That being said most are willing to go above and beyond if you go to office hours and more.  I will say for game dev specifically UCSC is more known, however people's interests can change. A friend of mine was dead set on Game-Dev but now they've moved over to do AI/ML stuff.   \n\n\nJob Opportunities: It all depends on you! I've been luckily enough to get 2 CS internships(one at Nasa this summer, and one last year at SAP) and I know some other people have gotten some good ones, but again its all on you. Companies don't just look at your school and go heres an internship.   \n\n\nKnowing people at your school coming in is a plus, but usually isn't something thats make or break.  UC Merced is a smaller campus(only 10 mins to get from one side to the other walking). For me I wish I had a larger campus just so that theres always something new to explore, but thats just a con for me. The campus is really new though overall compared to UCSC, esp the 2020 project.

You see, I\u2019m from a conservative area near San Diego and I happen to be a staunch conservative. I'm also a registered Republican.\n\nI believe in small, limited government; limited interference in the private sector and deregulation, i.e. free markets; pro-life policy; supporting the NRA and gun rights; the fact that climate change claims are way overblown; not being ashamed of my heritage; lowered taxes; curbing illegal immigration; and putting America First, etc.\n\nI\u2019m also an avid listener of podcasts and shows hosted by Ben Shapiro (my favorite), Steven Crowder, Dennis Prager, Michael Knowles, Andrew Klavan, Charlie Kirk, Jordan Peterson\u2026 the list goes on and on.\n\nNow, given that my views are right-wing, my question is: If I wore t-shirts to class and around campus that with messages such as, \"Facts don\u2019t care about your feelings\u201d or \u201cReagan Bush \u201884\u201d or \u201cSocialism Sucks\u201d or a \u201cCapitalism\u201d but in the style and font of the 'Coca-Cola' logo, would I be attacked for my views? Would I be singled out, scorned or ostracized by students who can\u2019t stand the fact that someone disagrees with their left-wing worldview? In other words, I refer to the hard line leftists who are common on every college campus -- the type of students who draw consistently on either emotion or logical fallacy instead of air-tight, sound arguments to present their positions like most on the right. You all know who I'm talking about, the students who tend to major in gender studies, ethnic studies or sociology. Now, I'm not insulting those fields; rather, I'm merely saying that they tend to attract individuals with particular political inclinations. I also believe these fields help entrench these extreme left-wing views in students. Simply, I want to know if these individuals will give me hard time for my openly conservative views.\n\nI also ask because I tend not to shy away from correcting liberal professors when they try to proselytize their left-wing socialist views in class. I did it all through high school and was known as the kid who wouldn\u2019t back down from an intellectual scuffle with my leftist teachers. At one point I even had to have a mediation in the vice-principal's office with my AP government teacher who couldn\u2019t get over the fact that I didn\u2019t buy his \u201ctax cuts are terrible for the economy myth.\" This was after it got pretty heated one day between us in class. Long story short, I agreed to no longer bring my \u201cliberal tears\u201d coffee mug to class every morning lest I set him off again, haha. But boy, was he full of rhetoric and baseless arguments. It was honestly kind of sad. It\u2019s just too bad my peers didn\u2019t see it. I actually should've kept quiet most of the time because I ran the risk of being graded unfairly and thus risking my position as one of my school's valedictorians. Luckily, it wasn't an issue. But the fact that I had to worry about it at all tells you a lot about the state of left-wing bias in schools these days: it's everywhere, especially in colleges.\n\nAnyway, I would just like to know what kind of an experience a proud conservative freshman would have, given these viewpoints and predilections. Based on the fact that UCLA is the top public university in the nation and attracts bright students, I don\u2019t expect to encounter many (if any) students who would do anything drastic, but you can never be too safe. Even schools like Yale have leftists who scram at professors and get away with it. That\u2019s why I inquire opinions on how the political climate is at the moment and what I can expect in the fall.\n\nAlso, how\u2019s the Republican club on campus? I honestly can\u2019t wait to join. Btw, if any kooky far-leftists are reading this: get ready because UCLA is about to produce another Ben Shapiro. \ud83d\ude09 You\u2019ve been warned, lol.

You'll see in the future DT majors getting into top MSDS and MSFE (Financial Engineering) programs, which will follow right after graduation.\n\nThere's a writeup to a DT [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvW-YjKaaaE) and it states:\n\n>This capstone major is the first in the world, both in name and content. One key academic difference from the Data Science majors proposed by peer universities is the presence in our major of substantial upper division proof-based mathematics. The major is strong, perhaps stronger than some Masters degrees, in Machine Learning, which is at the core of Data Science. Most Data Science programs focus on teaching students the methods of data modeling, analysis, and engineering. What is missing is a rigorous understanding of the statistical and mathematical foundational concepts that underlie these methods. Without these, data scientists lack the understanding to deal with the plethora of problems they will face. UCLA\u2019s Data Theory major fills this need.\n\nUCLA will always be theory-based, because the faculty wants students to have a comprehensive knowledge of the subject(s) at hand without any voids. Here's a look at the [Math](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=Mathematics) and [Stats](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=Statistics) coursework; it's extremely comprehensive.

But for most everyone else, it's not hard to get classes.\n\n\\-- **UCLA students are complainers**. Based on Reddit it's obvious they would be, but I think it's this forum that is drawing a lot of these students. With Reddit, as in any forum,  one has to take the good by wading through the bad. The Management and Economics departments often incur the wrath of Reddit posters (but I think there are a bunch of UCB and USC lurkers here).\n\n\\-- **UCLA is a tough-grading, ultra-competitive school where grade deflations exists.** Not true, [the average gpa of a baccalaureate recipient was 3.59 in 2021-22](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/11qrpl2/here_are_2022_ucla_baccalaureate_gpas_by_time_to/). The students at the University are actually very collaborative. The capstone projects will often, mostly be collaborative projects. I think what would be good is if Bizecon were a capstone major project with outside companies. But if one is diligent in taking internships, then one should place very well.\n\n\\-- **The Economics/Management courses are extremely harsh grading.** [If it's not really true for the Engineering department](https://registrar.ucla.edu/registration-classes/graduation/final-degree-audit/honors) \\-- about .07 of a gpa difference in its 80th percentile grads compared to L&S -- it wouldn't be true of Economics. I think where they get this idea is, e.g., from a financial modeling class like Management 142A, where the curve is high because the professor requires every detail be correct for what would be easy exercises. What students from this class have to understand is that you can't submit mistake-ridden financial reports. Classes 142B & C will have progressively harder exercises of course.\n\n\\-- **UC Lotsa Accountants,** based off of a USC/UCB uninformed Reddit post of the past. This is false. Besides, USC, UCSB, and the Cal States probably produce most of the accountant types in CA at present, with UCLA producing a decent amount. The *lotsa accountants* notion might have been true at one point in the past, but the Bizecon major is now extremely varied in its job placements with consulting, Banking/Investments -- I purposely reversed the order, but UCLA places well in IB with internships, internships, internships -- and marketing, with all improving now that Bizecon and Econ majors are adding things like Stats, Specialization in Computing, or Data Science Engineering/ Social Data Science) to the major.  So they're going quant if not specifically related to quant-trading.\n\nUCLA doesn't offer marketing except for a few courses in Communications, and consequently those wanting this field major in Comm, Sociology, and/or Psychology. Some students are attracted more by pure Economics, and Quant Econ should really blow up at UCLA; I'm hoping at least.\n\n[Economics](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=economics) has a lot of class offerings for its varied concentrations with numerous classes outside of its typical realm.

Most of the graduates were at *3+ to 4 years* in attaining 180(+) units in spring of 2022, and additionally in attaining the units to satisfy their major(s), and were in the high-school graduating cohort of 2018, meaning that's when they entered UCLA, which would be right around four years in completing their degrees. This was 54.4% of the entire graduating class which included transfers, and of just those who entered from high school they were 87% of the graduating class. This doesn't mean that 87% graduated in four years; that number was 84.5% who took their degrees at the max of four years (again, of those who entered from HS and from the 2018 cohort).\n\nThe question, as related to what you're asking could be: How would that 3.59 average at graduation for the whole class relate just to life-science/bio grads? Most of the grads are in Letters & Science (L&S) and Bio is in L&S. As related to [Latin Honors](https://registrar.ucla.edu/registration-classes/graduation/final-degree-audit/honors) which is calculated to the thousandth in gpa and awards these three honors to the top 20% of the graduating class, L&S would be somewhere in the middle of all of UCLA's colleges and schools in ascendant gpas. But, again, L&S is the largest of colleges, and there are a good number of Bio students at UCLA, so it would appear that Bio majors could or should uphold the \\~3.59 average. But then, it could actually be higher because if a group of students maintain a lower gpa in their first couple of years, they may opt out of Bio and switch to, say, the social sciences.\n\nAssuming the points above are relatable, if you factor in Latin Honors into the mix (and LH is calculated to the thousandth of gpa), a good 20% of Bio majors would have \u2265 3.881 (3.88) gpa at graduation, per the lowest gpa of Cum Laude honors for L&S. This would seemingly imply, assuming a normal curve, that the 70th percentile grads would have \u2265 3.80 gpa, and it might dip to \\~ 68th percentile. But the average for Bio-related majors could be higher than the class average too as per above, as Bio majors could be majorly culled. So I'd say that a good 1/3 of the graduating Bio Sciences class would have at least a 3.8 gpa.\n\nIt doesn't appear that UCLA has grade deflation but it wouldn't have the inflation that is seemingly seen at some of the Ivy colleges.", "score": 8, "author": "noclouds82degrees", "page_title": "Reddit - Dive into anything"}, {"id": "jd72c74", "body": "No, grading has been fair from my experience, if not inflated.

Additionally, gaining internships will often be a function of scholarship in the classes students have taken as well as whom one knows, which is why being in a frat or sorority will help with ins and connections in various b-sectors.\n\nAlso, some complain that UCLA's business-related clubs are too exclusive, but that would be anywhere. However, there are clubs like the Undergraduate Business Society,  largest club on campus, which will take anyone as will Bruin Real Estate Association (BREA), which is mainly more for those interested in commercially based RE.

Econ and Bizecon are short to fairly short majors, so Stats is a good addition.\n\nSome are even adding a Specialization in Computing offering which has Java and Python, or some are now adding the Social Data Science or Data Science Engineering minors.\n\nThere are natural minors to the three majors, E, BE, ME, in Accounting and Entrepreneurship. But these two minors can be added to any major in any department, and I've heard of Sociology majors adding Accounting, and Communications, Biology, History majors, any major, adding Entrepreneurship.\n\nI've also heard of Bizecon majors adding math, or just going with one of the various Mathematics majors. There are some who are getting jobs at PwC or Deloitte who are majoring in Cognitive Science.

If this attitude is taken, then BE, E, ME, or pure Business wouldn't be \"cutting it\" on a pure educational and preparation standpoint because a BS/BA degree is more generally based instead having a narrow specificity as to a particular company/firm, which besides, would be impossible.\n\nThis is why internships in the all-encompassing sphere of business are so important. And that's why I've recommended that those who want to enter whatever business sector take as many internships as possible, even after this person graduates if needed, so that this student or grad can find one's calling and for the prospective employer to find the right employee fit on the firm's /company's side.\n\nAll I was saying for BE, E, or ME majors to do was to add some of these minors and concentrations to be able to fit whatever mold specific companies are seeking and to be armed with the tools that they provide.\n\nAdditionally, Economics and sometimes Accounting are very important coursework that pure business majors will include in their studies, and you'll find that they are required to take macro, micro and elementary accounting.\n\nThere are some economists who could foretell that banks and the markets would have trouble with the fed tinkering with rates and funds that came true wrt to the banks and hopefully won't come to pass wrt the markets, so an overview of economic conditions affecting one's firm/company is imperative.\n\nAnd accounting is essential for accounting, obviously, and for finance. There's a famous Reddit post called U See Lotsa Accountants, using the approximate acronym of the University written by, I'm guessing, a USC or UCB grad -- I don't know when it originated, but this person was denigrating what ASM and the Economics department were offering and that they were only preparing students for accounting. It was a stupid post because accounting is essential for the broad world of finance.\n\nAnyway, adding things like the DS minors, accounting, computing specialization, value investing, entrepreneurship, are to prepare BE, E, ME grads for the very broad world of business, and to help them to be marketable in various business sectors, more so that they could choose what field in which they want to be employed, not that specifically BE is particularly lacking and their having to add these courses. And the purpose of BE is not to get a job, but to get a really good one, which it enables those who major in it to do.\n\nI'd like to see UCLA add a marketing minor, and, say, house it in Communications. I'd like to see UCLA add a few RE classes, and a few more finance-related ones, but accounting is sufficient for this latter, as well as the 142 A-C classes. In fact these three classes were added because of student input, I believe. But, also, most of the top-tier universities in the country don't have pure Business majors.", "score": 2, "author": "noclouds82degrees"}, {"id": "jdlkl16", "body": ">That's an indicator that the Bus Econ major isn't cutting it on the quantitative front.\n\nYou got all that from what I wrote? There are lots of Business Economics and Economics majors who are not adding Stats, Math, Accounting, etc., and they're going into various bus sectors in numerous capacities. Additionally, there are Bio and Polisci majors who are going into consulting, and there are Comm and Soc majors who are going into marketing. I know a Sociology grad who is working for one of the big three consulting firms, partly in whom she knew. And she's doing very well.\n\nReal estate marketing and finance are not needful of a degree in RE nor are they needful of a Business, Marketing, Econ, or Bizecon degree, especially if one starts out, say, in brokerage house in Commercial RE. I have friends who are in the field  who majored in history, sociology, and polisci, off their internships, and a lot of it is their marketing abilities and in whom they know, as it is essentially a fraternity and extremely male dominated. Then there are Residential RE brokers/agents who majored in Art History or French or anything else, and much of this is female-based.\n\nEventually some of these persons might want to get into the financing and investing within developmental RE with their own inventory of, say, land, and/or for clients, and it's something they learn in being employed in the field.\n\nEveryone says that to get into IB major is not important, but more in whom one knows, and getting to know people is often dependent on being in clubs, both the inclusive and exclusive ones, and being in a house can help. Of course, there is the sell-side and the buy-side, with the latter being more technical within finance.\n\nAdditionally, accounting is essential for non-marketing-based finance because an analyst needs to be able to read financial statements to be able to project future events of companies from an external point of view, and budgeting if this person is working internally. This is why a lot of UCLA students who want to get into the this field major in Econ or Bizecon and minor in accounting. They could go to work for an accounting firm, or they could go for a financial analyst position, but some of the big-five in accounting are going into consulting and other fields.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the accounting classes ASM offers undergrads is not only for that profession but is also for financial modeling, so the idea that these management classes are \"just a few accounting and finance courses added mainly to economics\" is pretty erroneous or however you worded things, and I noted the 10 106 A-V courses, in addition to entrepreneurial classes too.

It employed ridicule, irony, and caricature.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotice that the title of the essay \"A Modest Proposal\" is ironic as it implies that the proposal is not asking for a whole lot, however, when the reader begins to delve into the essay, they are taken aback by the absurdity and preposterousness of it all. Eating babies?! How could someone suggest something so outright disgusting and wrong? Clearly, Swift was not serious. The idea of eating babies is a caricature of the immorality that was going on during the time period that the essay was written. A caricature is \"a picture, **description**, or imitation of a person \\[or **thing**\\] in which certain **striking characteristics are exaggerated** in order to create a comic or **grotesque effect**\" (taken from Google). Eating babies exaggerates the immorality, therefore eating babies is immoral, and an extreme of it at that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople knew in 18th century Ireland that eating human babies is wrong, killing human babies is wrong, and farming human babies is wrong. Somewhere in history, people decided to do away with morality and strip the value away from certain human beings because of their size, location, or stage of development. \"A Modest Proposal\" is not pro-abortion or pro-infanticide literature. It has a better argument for being pro-life, effectively employing pathos to get the reader to feel compassion for defenseless human babies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome more important definitions if you need help following along:\n\n**Grotesque:** comically or repulsively ugly or distorted.\n\n**Derision:** contemptuous ridicule or mockery.\n\n**Caricature:** make or give a comically or grotesquely exaggerated representation of (someone or something).", "score": -8, "author": "SomethingBadBruin"}, {"id": "jivgzzc", "body": "On the gang", "score": 2, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivhim3", "body": "He did it on purpose just so i could talk to you", "score": 3, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivhot7", "body": "would you have my baby?", "score": 3, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivkmku", "body": "What are they based on sexy?", "score": 4, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivld08", "body": "Would you let me hit it raw and get you pregnant?", "score": 2, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivoxrm", "body": "we can sterilize all genders so no one gets pregnant on accident then incubate the reproductive process through machines", "score": 4, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivmvdj", "body": "Damn sexy ur so big brain", "score": 3, "author": "georgiapeaches000"}, {"id": "jivp0l2", "body": "source: trust me bro", "score": 3, "author": "folieas"}, {"id": "jivr1wc", "body": "Fella, that\u2019s a lot of words all to say a whole bunch of nothing.", "score": 5, "author": "MelancholyZebra"}, {"id": "jivv88h", "body": "Bro I was an English major you didn\u2019t have to write an essay on the most basic form of satire to me.

Tercero now has the newest dorms on average and is notable for being really close to the cows, arboretum, football stadium, and engineering dept (none of which are super big perks/cons, just points of reference).

Getting involved in student activism! One issue or another, like with most (if not, all) UC's, UC Davis has always been recognized as one of the leading UC's in student advocacy, and that means there are more than plenty activities to start.

The person detained Wednesday at about 5 p.m. a block from Sycamore Park matched the description of the suspect in two of the attacks, and was wearing black Adidas pants with a white stripe similar to those seen by witnesses.\"\n\nRead more at: [https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article275012191.html#storylink=cpy](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article275012191.html#storylink=cpy)\"", "score": 16, "author": "needforcaffeine"}, {"id": "jiupum4", "body": "Wow, I\u2019m surprised they think it\u2019s the same dude arrested yesterday.

He previously lived in Oakland, where he played high-school football and ran track. He also aspired to become a doctor, according to an online profile for a medical internship in which he described \u201chow health care can be fun.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe people think it\u2019s boring or it\u2019s scary if you\u2019re a surgeon and you see all that blood, but saving someone\u2019s life makes you feel good about yourself,\u201d Reales said.\u00a0\n\nReales declined an interview request Thursday from The Davis Enterprise.\n\nEarlier Thursday, police erected crime-scene tape on Hawthorn Lane south of West Eighth Street. Police Chief Darren Pytel confirmed it is Reales\u2019 residence, which lies a short walk from all three stabbing scenes.\n\nHis arrest sent a wave of relief through the Davis Police Department, which extended officers\u2019 shifts and called in dozens more personnel from surrounding law-enforcement agencies to safeguard an anxious community and solve the city\u2019s unprecedented crime spree.\u00a0\n\nPytel said Reales \u201cphysical evidence that was apparent on him\u201d at the time he was detained, including biological evidence. A pat-down revealed a large double-edged knife that \u201cwas consistent with the knife we were looking for from the first crime.\u201d\n\nPytel said detectives continue to investigate the motive for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a significant amount of work being done, including analyzing all the evidence that\u2019s being collected today,\u201d as well as DNA, fingerprint and fiber comparisons, Pytel said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe events leading to Reales\u2019 arrest began at about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday when a man walking through Sycamore Park spotted him sitting alone on the children\u2019s playground.\u00a0\n\nWith shoulder-length wavy hair, and wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and black Adidas track pants, he bore a strong resemblance to the suspect seen fleeing the L Street stabbing scene.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe made eye contact with me and came toward me rather briskly,\u201d said the witness, who asked to remain anonymous. He said he backed off at that point but \u201ckept an eye on him\u201d as Reales wandered through the park, then through the neighborhood east of it.\n\n\u201cHe was walking around sort of aimlessly, which I though was odd,\u201d said the witness, who continued following the person from a distance to The Marketplace shopping center, where he briefly lost sight of him. Reales later emerged from a store and walked back toward the park area.\n\nThe witness said he called police multiple times as he tracked Reales, ultimately flagging down an officer heading westbound on Villanova Drive toward the park. Reales began walking more briskly at that point but never tried to run.\u00a0\n\nAdditional police units responded to the scene, bringing numerous residents outside to watch the commotion. Reales, who was cuffed initially, left unrestrained with police shortly after 5 p.m.\n\nPolice cautioned at the time that Reales was not placed under arrest, but rather volunteered to accompany officers to the Davis police station in order to give a statement.\n\nWednesday\u2019s tips added to hundreds police have received over the past week, reporting people who matched the suspect\u2019s description and other suspicious activity being observed.\u00a0\n\nThe description first emerged early Sunday, after a witness who interrupted the attack on Najm in Sycamore Park briefly followed the suspect as he left the stabbing scene with Najm\u2019s bicycle.\n\nWitnesses to the L Street assault, and the victim himself, offered similar descriptions following that incident. One man said he saw the suspect lurking among some nearby trees some two hours before the stabbing.\n\n\u201cWe asked the community to provide tips, and they delivered, meaningfully,\u201d Pytel said. \u201cThat has to be recognized,\u201d along with the law-enforcement teams he said worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to solve the case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nReales remains in Yolo County Jail custody on a no-bail hold, his arraignment likely taking place early next week in Yolo Superior Court.\n\nA 2020 graduate of Castlemont High School in Oakland, Reales spent the summer of 2017 as an intern at the West Oakland Health Center, and the summer before at Mentoring in Medicine and Science (MIMS), also in Oakland, according to his LinkedIn profile.\u00a0\n\nThe Oakland Health Pathways Partnership \u2014 a collaboration among the Oakland Unified School District, Alameda Health System and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency \u2014\u00a0featured Reales prominently on its website, where he said wanted to \u201cgive back to the community\u201d as a doctor.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI got into health care to help my grandmother \u2014 she has type 2 diabetes,\u201d Reales said. \u201cMy grandmother used to take care of me when I was young, and now I take care of her. I\u2019m the oldest in my family. My parents work, so I take care of my younger brother and sister, take them to school. I help with the cooking and cleaning.\n\n\u201cMIMS introduced me to connections with people and a network of hospitals,\u201d added Reales, who toured several hospitals as part of the program. \u201cI saw how health care can be fun. Maybe people think it\u2019s boring or it\u2019s scary if you\u2019re a surgeon and you see all that blood, but saving someone\u2019s life makes you feel good about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reach Lauren Keene at lkeene@davisenterprise.net.

In a survey we did of r/UCSD, 2/3 respondents agreed r/UCSD didn't represent UCSD's overall student body. \n\n# A few useful links:\n\n* [The New Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVRH3wrEK3RQ5OZ9cLyPYhzUTtlkNlxq5W9QEIr_CwM/edit?fbclid=IwAR3EwJJxHZsGClKT65_eI_C8a2vsp0yPtdOX9zH6K9he6SQ-vTVBgqJqsik)\n* [UCSD Incoming Student FAQ - The Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBOha62mF0onJOq-f5FuGR4MdNZDLZwhR1GnSrnA1es/edit)\n* Discord Servers\n   * [Class of 2027 Discord](https://discord.gg/HCPwmKhXgB)\n   * [Class of 2025 Discord]( https://discord.gg/6rGpBksv5S)\n   * Additional servers can be found through the [UCSD Discord Servers MegaDoc](https://ucsd.edu/go/discord) after getting your UCSD email. \n* [TritonLink](https://students.ucsd.edu/)\n* [UCSD Support](https://support.ucsd.edu/services)\n* [UCSD Admissions](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/)\n* [r/UCSD Copypasta Archive (need to start the meme indoctrination early)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/wiki/copypasta)\n* [4 Year Plans](http://plans.ucsd.edu)\n\nPlease be aware stuff at UCSD can change *fast*. Most info you can find on this subreddit will still hold true, but there were some major changes in 2020 (Sixth College has a brand new location, Seventh College exists where transfers used to live, transfers moved to a different area).\n\nEighth College is brand new for Fall 2023, with its housing still currently being under construction. As a result, we don't have as much specific info about it besides the GE requirements and the location. \n\n# How do I login to check my admissions decision?\n\nYou should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).\n\n# Can I switch to Computer Science? / I was accepted undeclared but I applied CS!:\n\nIf you were not accepted directly into CSE:CS or CSE:CE (not ECE:CE) and are dead set on being a CS major, you should not attend UCSD. Being admitted undeclared basically means you were accepted to UCSD, but the CSE department rejected your application. Switching into CS is now effectively impossible. The CSE department does not anticipate there being ANY slots for current UCSD students to switch into. More details can be found on the [CSE Capped Major Webpage](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse-capped-admissions-program). *Assume it will be impossible to switch into Computer Science if you were not directly admitted to the major.*\n\n~~Computer Engineering is a bit different, CSE CE and ECE CE are the exact same major requirements (only the advisors are different), but ECE CE is subject to the ECE capped major system (which is not a lottery but requires a high GPA in the screening courses) while CSE CE is subject to the CSE system. So if you are okay with CE instead of CS, you can try going for ECE:CE. It will still be challenging and is far from guaranteed.~~ \n\n[**EDIT: ECE CE WILL NO LONGER BE AN OPTION AND IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE AS WELL.** ](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/capped-major-status)\n\nIf you are set on UCSD but not set on CS, the [Computing Paths page](http://computingpaths.ucsd.edu/) lists other computing related majors that UCSD has such as Math-CS, Cognitive Science, Data Science, etc (but keep in mind these are NOT CS).\n\n# What does the college I got affect? Can I change college? \n\nFor freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.\n\nYour major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (Seventh to the future site of Eighth). \n\nYou cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable. \n\n# I'm waitlisted. What should I do next?\n\n[From UC San Diego Admission Website](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/first-year/application-timeline.html)\n\n> Select applicants will be invited to opt in to our waitlist through their Applicant Portal.\n\n> First-Year applicants must opt in by 11:59 pm PST on April 15.\n\n> Being on the waitlist does not guarantee an offer of admission. We strongly urge students to accept another university's admission offer before the appropriate deadline to ensure they have secured a spot at an institution.\n\n> By June 30, final decisions will be released to applicants who opt in to the waitlist.

If anyone wants to comment on this choice, pls do. My parents are still a bit dicy since they have a huge personal belief that UIUC is the premium cs and tech school after the big 4 (mit Stanford uc berk and cmu). I told them that UIUC's school of information is not that good as UIUC cs and engineering in terms of placement and strength of the degree. Another ug student from UIUC told me that I only need to do calc 2 level study for data sciences. Inner me was disappointed af since I have already done linear algebra and my maths teacher (a gem) is conducting discrete math classes for me since March beginning\n\n2. Do maths cs majors get good internships? I have done Harvard cs 50 courses, both intro and web dev one. I took private classes before for coding in order to be good at competitive programming. I feel more than rigorous coding, I became more interested in the maths part and cracking puzzles through algorithms. Before coming to UCSD, what should I do to get a leg up. (I have already relaxed during my final exams \ud83d\ude2d, now I really wanna return to old me so pls tell the courses to do. I can't rest) \n\n3. I have good graphics skill wrt to ui designing in Adobe softwares. How do I use this to my advantage? I can go ahead with front end dev I guess for getting side jobs or internships during my freshman year. So, my questions basically revolves around the fact that do frosh students get internships via UCSD or not. \n\n4. Dating scene: how tough is it to approach girls? \n\n5.

CS was my first choice, but I'm very much content with where I'm at right now.\n\n>What are your thoughts on this major? Do you think it's worth going here if I stay in this major but only want to work in tech?\n\nMath-CS is a pretty good major. The main thing I like about Math-CS is that it's *flexible* \\-- if I wanted to, I could have graduated a year earlier. Or, I could do off-season tech internships/co-ops. Or, I could take classes that were interesting.\n\nYes. I know many Math-CS majors who have interned at pretty big companies or otherwise are working full-time as software engineers. I've interned last Fall and will be interning during the summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>One thing I'm worried about is how people might view this major as an interdisciplinary major that requires a few extra years of grad school, plus the extra time spent juggling between computer science and especially math courses which are not my strong suit.\n\nThis is a valid concern, and one that I've had when I was deciding between where I wanted to go.\n\nWith regards to the courses, yes, you will need to take a number of math classes. If you absolutely despise math, you absolutely *do not* want to be a Math-CS major. It's simply not worth your time or the suffering. However, if you're *open* to taking math classes, I can tell you that most of the upper-level math classes I've taken (proof-based classes) were pretty interesting and eye-opening, albeit challenging. That being said, a lot of classes you will need to take will be pretty challenging, so keep that in mind.\n\nWith regards to grad school, I never really saw it like that. The people I know who are going to grad school are people who generally either want to specialize in a certain field, want to take more CS courses, or are simply doing it because they don't have a job at the end of the day (and this applies to everyone, not just Math-CS students). From talking to Math-CS graduates, you can very well succeed in industry with just a B.S. in Math-CS.\n\n>However, the other options I have are not very good in my opinion and alongside its popularity I always thought about going to this school for reasons such as being close to home and the very nice beaches (Even though Warren is probably the farthest from those beaches).\n\nKeep in mind that we have pretty decent transportation through MTS and NCTD, two of San Diego's transportation systems. UCSD students get \"free\" passes that allow for unlimited rides on buses and light rail on both transit services (I say \"free\" in quotes because you're really paying for it through your student fees).\n\nAmong other options, you can take MTS Bus 30 to downtown La Jolla, Pacific Beach, and so on. Or, you can take NCTD Bus 101 to Del Mar, Solana Beach, Carlsbad, and so on. These buses, and many more, all stop by our campus (Gilman Transit Center, or Gilman & Myers).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you went back in time, would you change your decision to enroll at UCSD for Mathematics-Computer Science?\n\nNo. I've made a lot of friends here and I feel like I've learned a lot.\n\n\\------\n\nI do want to say this, though.\n\n> The other schools I got accepted to were UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced for Computer Science. \n\nIf you 100% want to do pure CS, you should look into the other schools. The other UCs are all good UCs. \n\n> I was accepted to UC Irvine as Undeclared. \n\nI'm not sure if things have changed, but I'm pretty sure the only difficult part about switching into CS at UCI is that it's hard to get into some of the classes that you need in order to switch (since you do not have priority registration). You might want to see if r/UCI has any additional information on this, though. \n\n\\------\n\nI probably didn't answer all of your questions too in-depth, so feel free to respond back if you have any questions.

Though after two quarters I felt like once I explored everything I kinda felt stagnant. Your pros and cons for UCD are very valid lol. The best thing I loved about Davis is how great the DCs were and the fresh food (Cuarto dining bias). From what I remembered it was unlimited swipes and the ARC is great.

I had a family death occur fall my first year and that weighted on me a lot. Personally decided to drop out during covid and take a gap year back home. I have completely enjoyed and grateful for my experience at UCD for being so far from home, but it also made me appreciate my loved ones a lot more.\n\nMy favorite aspect of UCSD is definitely how resourceful the campus is. Majority of lectures are automatically podcasted and makes attending optional (But also might not be the best learning experience, in person lectures definitely help me learn the best). I think the professors (at least in the psych department) have a really good balance of great teaching and research. Being at a very research driven school your knowledge is very in tune of the most up to date science. Some of my upper div classes don't require textbooks because they are too outdated and my professor's research is being taught. I haven't had a bad professor experience here but I can think of a few professors at UCD that I did not enjoy. \n\nThe location is the prime spot in San Diego. The ocean is less than a mile away and you will have a free trolley pass to go to anywhere in SD. Everywhere on campus is walkable and each college give a cool environmental feel.

So the thing with being a k-12 teacher in the US is that in basically every state, you need two qualifications: a bachelor's degree and a teaching credential. Teaching credentials are state-by-state, but with some reciprocity. A bachelor's degree is obviously universal. The thing is that it doesn't really matter what degree you have - generally you'll need a STEM degree to teach STEM in a High School, but otherwise, they don't really care. \n\nSo, the upside of going for EDS is that you get the education theory. However, the education theory you'll get studying EDS is really not that helpful - you're gonna get that getting your credential anyway, as well via CEUs (continuing education units) that you'll need to be getting every year. Because you don't get a credential after a 4-year EDS degree, you still have to go through the post-bacc process, which costs money and time. I think some of your practicum counts towards credential hours (not sure about that, I could be wrong - either way, you can't graduate and go straight to a teaching job).\n\nThe big risk is if you realize teaching isn't for you. Please understand that I don't want to poo-poo your dream - I share it. I really loved working in schools when I did, and quite a few of the teachers I worked with encouraged me to go into the field myself. The thing that scared me off it is that almost universally, every teacher over about 45 I met was burnt out and either felt numb or hated their job. This was at multiple districts, one in a very poor neighborhood (ARUSD) and one in a wealthy neighborhood (SJUSD, and a wealthy area at that). If you have a degree in EDS and decide you want out, your options are basically: more school, sales for a company that sells to schools, or some kind of adult training/teaching role (which tend to be hard to get since a lot of people flee teaching, sadly.) \n\nOn the other hand, if you get a degree in something else that you like and are interested in but that also has some value on the job market, you've got more options if you decide teaching isn't for you. A good middle ground is a double major, which shouldn't be too bad since EDS is not that bad compared to a lot of majors. EDS has a [program](https://eds.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/major.html#Senior-Educational-Fieldwork-Ca) where you can double major and then skip some of the subject matter tests you'd need to take to teach specific subjects. \n\nNo matter what you choose, I wish you good luck!
