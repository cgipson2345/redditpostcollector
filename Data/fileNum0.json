If you're stuck on the negative aspects, then will you harp on the negative aspects of life, job, career, etc? Now, I won't say riverside is better than other cities like LA, etc because it's not. It's not comparable, BUT that doesn't mean it's not a good place to come to. \n\nAlso, if you guys complain about homeless, then you really need to grow up. Do you think they want to be homeless? A lot of things probably went down that you didnt see and the fact you judge someone based on their appearance rather than themselves. It's just sad.

I'd say for those who complain to really look inside yourself and ask why don't you like it at riverside? There's an underlying reason why you may not enjoy riverside as compared to others.

I don't think they realize how privileged they are at all.\n\nI'm just a prospective transfer student atm, but I moved out to Riverside after high school because it was more affordable than San Diego. The homeless situation in Riverside is just as comparable to other major cities (except OC because we all know what they do to them there), but people who complain about homeless are ignorant. These are people that society have failed. And they exist everywhere.\n\nI think people fail to realize that UCR is such a great campus and the city isn't too bad either, but they can't see past University Ave.... which isn't even that bad imo.  At the same time though, you get Sycamore Canyon not too far away.. There's Round1 in Moreno Valley... Rancho Cucamonga has some decent shopping. There's awesome Mexican food (and that's coming from a San Diegan with TJ tacos right next door). Like omg I was so happy to find out there's a 2 Potrillos in my hometown Chula Vista too. Hands down my favorite place in the IE for tacos. There's Vietnamese, Filipino, Thai, even dimsum and Mokkoji now!!! Like it may not be the extensive variety of LA perhaps, but it's not a cultural wasteland for sure. I mean, the number of boba shops that is around campus??? That's more than what people in Chula Vista have wtf.\n\nI think some genuine complaints should mostly be about the fact that Riverside has plenty of \"food desert\" areas like around Highgrove, Grand Terrace, or Jurupa.  But I feel like that's just due to city planning around all the industrial zones... still a concern though. \n\nAnother thing is IE driving... which is like LA driving, but worse 'cause there's actually space to be an aggressive driver here lol. But then again, I come from SD where everyone drives like sheep \ud83d\ude43 ahem. But again, you get your different flavors of bad drivers everywhere in the world. Heck, I'm not completely innocent either haha.\n\nIn general, you need a car to get anywhere noteworthy here, but the same could be said in San Diego/LA as well. So, I don't understand why people make such a big deal out of it.\n\nIdk very discombobulated comment from me, sorry. I just feel like I have so much to say about this, I love Riverside so much. It's not perfect, sure. But people here aren't pretentious at all like they are in SD, OC, LA... and at the same time there's so much good to be found here as well if you take the time to find it.

I grew to see past that. And now, having been at UCR for the past four years or so, most of those original criticisms have disappeared. Riverside is a second home to me.\n\nI\u2019ve come to thoroughly enjoy what Riverside and the IE have to offer. The friends and connections I\u2019ve made down here are priceless. The memories I\u2019ve made with those people will forever be a part of my college journey.\n\nSome complaints are valid.\n\nYes, the air is smoggy and causes breathing problems. Yes, the water is hard and dries out skin. But those can be remedied with some research and purchasing a quality air purifier and water filter.\n\nYes, there is homelessness. Yes, there is crime.

If you come from a place of privilege and complain about this, surely you can afford a tower fan or that electricity bill\u2026\n\nFor those that complain about the lack of things to do around here: there is certainly a lot to do around here! Just be open-minded and willing to explore. Look into different modes of transport if Riverside isn\u2019t your cup of tea. Zipcars are an option: cheap membership and reasonable hourly rates (w/ gas included!) \n\nIf that\u2019s out of reach, public transit is an excellent alternative: RTA is free for UCR students, and the Metrolink is amazing if heading out towards LA (or anywhere in between)!\n\nIt does feel like some complaints mask what a student truly feels about the region and the people who call it home.

{"subreddit": "ucla", "body": "Hello UCLA students! A tip from someone who has been here for a while and lived in student housing and multiple apartments in the area. If you want your sanity intact after your stay here, do not rent with premier student housing! They really should be called shit housing for torturing unsuspecting students. I will tell you why. \n\nI moved into their levering avenue complex a few years ago. My first year there were some minor issues with the unit but nothing unbearable. I was rent controlled with them and I didn't need to worry about finding roommates, so it seemed great! Oh, except they don't vet roommates and it's a literal carousel of people in the summer. These people stay for a few weeks and often don't care about the space.  I thought, well, that's ok! It's still a good price and another year won't hurt. \n\nThe next year I noticed a humidity issue that led to mold starting to crop up. We cleaned, we really did but it kept coming back. We would get them to fix leaks we noticed and that our neighbors noticed, but it never really went away. I was a frog being slowly boiled yall. I was not prepared for the nightmare that was my third year there. Also the management is horribly unprofessional. \n\nThey started using a utility company that would charge us literally hundreds of dollars a month. Impossible amounts of utilities. Currently for the utilities we were required to pay for (water, gas, trash) I never pay over 100 dollars for a unit of a comparable size (honestly even that is more than I usually pay by a large margin....). They would send misspelled emails riddled with typos. Maintenance took forever even with emergency issues. The weird manager, who went by different names depending on who was talking to them, accused of sabotaging showings. Showings they would schedule and then show up for on different days, or without warning. \n\nI regularly spent days without a working toilet in that apartment. We had our bathtub fill with sewage (our downstairs neighbors did too!) They said we complained too much because it took them 12 + hours to come and start fixing it. There were multiple instances of construction in our unit. It was disgusting. And it turns out that the mold and humidity were from a long standing leak that I'm pretty sure was from deep issues with old pipes. In short, that place is contaminated with mold for sure. \n\nSave your sanity. Their other buildings are also old and poorly managed. If you like sewage and rude people this is the place for you though! I got really good at plunging toilets and now I'm not phased by bodily fluids. \n\nDid I mention they don't vet roommates and I once had to clean up vomit to use my own toilet? Yeah. \n\nIn short, fuck premier student housing. I hope their company fails \ud83e\udd70\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the awards and I am a little flabbergasted at how this all blew up. I am just glad that students are now aware of this predatory company and that students leasing with them can band together now.

{"subreddit": "UCDavis", "body": "I posted on this sub a few days ago asking about the tallest building on campus.\n\nI was not trying to stargaze, throw parties, nor do anything fun.\n\nYes, I tried to jump off a building and end my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of you might have seen my personal story from my previous post (it has been deleted so I would appreciate if you do not share any personal details about me). I have been extremely struggling from academic, personal, family, financial struggles and many more without any access to a proper care. Out of years of depression, multiple suicide attempts, and desperation, I had no other choice as my life has been stuck on the very bottom of the ferris wheel ever since I was born or I can remember. It seemed like the world has turned their back on me.\n\nI packed all my belongings so it would be easier for others to clean up my room once I'm gone. I wanted to write letters before the end, but I did not have anyone to write to nor anyone who could write one for me. So that's when I wanted to share my story as a stranger to other strangers, hoping one of them might recognize my presence and the struggles that I had to endure. I just wanted something of mine to be left when I am gone. And I was ready finally. When I posted a question, I was not trying to gather attention. All I planned out was once I see the very first comment with the building name, I was planning on heading there, and the rest was very clear.\n\nBut people reached out to me. Some people who identified themselves as a fellow student, faculty, staff, and even a complete non-UCD affiliated stranger reached out to me. They offered me resources and heartwarming words. I was hesitant. But after reading all those messages and comments, I gave myself another chance telling myself that one day, my life will be better, and some day, I might reach the top of the ferris wheel happily looking down all my accomplishments after years of struggles.\n\nAlthough I am not fully recovered yet, I feel better for now. As the crisis counselor I met said, it is going to be a long journey, but what really matters is taking one step at a time: Give yourself a chance one day at a time and give others\u2014counselors, classmates, other people who are here to help\u2014a chance. So I did, and hopefully I will keep doing so.\n\nI just wanted to share this for those who were concerned or curious about my whereabouts, and I wanted to thank every one of you who reached out to me. Even though it is going to be a difficult and long journey, I will give myself a try. So if anyone who\u2019s reading this is in a similar situation, please give yourself a try too.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart everyone for saving my life.

{"subreddit": "berkeley", "body": "(Mirroring from my CS161 piazza post)\n\n\nAs you know, I've been following COVID very closely and trying to keep students informed of the situation.  And although I'm not an epidemiologist, my research includes the computer equivalents.  We are about to enter a very, very dark December and you should all prepare now.\n\nAs a reminder, COVID is an airborne pathogen but requires a significant challenge dose to be infected.  Airborne/aerosol means it is carried around in particles with roughly the size and behavior of smoke.  Worse, asymptomatic but infected individuals spread the virus very effectively.  Talking and singing spread more particles than just breathing.  This is why mask wearing is so critical: even the most basic cloth mask acts as a fairly effective filter for these particles when you breath out.\n\nSo imagine an infected person is smoking a joint.  For a pathogen like measles, if you smell the joint and were unvaccinated you'd be infected.  With COVID, you need a contact high.  This is why outdoors is so much safer than indoors, fleeting contact is far less significant than sustained contact, and why restaurants, bars, and family gatherings are such effective spreaders.  A bar, especially in winter, is a literal COVID hot-box.\n\nIt is also important to understand the risk.  For most University students the risk you face if you are infected with COVID is in roughly the same ballpark as joining a fraternity.  But it is a very different story for your parents: Even in the 40-50 year old range a COVID infection has a roughly 0.5% fatality rate when the hospital systems are well functioning, and this can drastically increase with both age and if the hospital system is overloaded.  Unless you are a sociopath, you would probably feel badly if, say, your wedding lead directly to 7 deaths.\n\nAt the same time, we are all suffering from COVID fatigue and claustrophobia.  We want this to end.  The good news is it will, soonish.  The timeline for widespread vaccinations in the spring is looking good, not just the Pfizer vaccine but others in the pipeline, and one of the few things the Administration has gotten right is building the distribution infrastructure now and agreeing to buy now large amounts of vaccine when it becomes available.\n\nBut with that background, the US is about to enter a crisis even worse than the first wave.\n\nCases have doubled in a little more than 10 days, the hospitals are already as full as they were in the first wave, and the US is proceeding like nothing is wrong.  United just added over 1400 flights for Thanksgiving.  At the same time the healthcare system is already breaking down: El Paso now has 10 refrigerated trucks serving as a temporary morgue while the state of Texas is suing to overturn local restrictions designed to reduce the spread!  Worse, hospitalizations lag cases by about a week and deaths by two weeks.  And yet a good 30% of the country thinks that masks are some plot to corrupt our precious bodily fluids.\n\nThis third wave is twice as many cases as the second (the first wave doesn't count for this comparison because the testing regime was too weak then).  That second wave had an average daily death toll of over 1000/day.  So as a nation we will be lucky if there is only one more doubling of the rate of new infections and a month of 2000-3000 dead each day: substantially more than the first wave.  But with the Thanksgiving holiday coming up, we are looking at a very dark December as so many are actively ignoring the pandemic.\n\nSo what to do?\n\nIt is time to effectively \"go to ground\", prepare to shelter in place for the next couple of months like the initial lockdown.  If you are with your parents, stay there.  But if you aren't, do not return home unless they get sick: this includes both Thanksgiving and the Christmas holiday.  Don't dine indoors, don't work out indoors, don't meet anyone outside your household indoors.  And spread the word to your family and those you love.\n\nThanksgiving-time shopping is going to be particularly perilous.  Grocery shop for the next two weeks now to avoid the pre-Thanksgiving mobs at the stores.  When you do go out, try to wear one of the disposable blue procedure masks rather than just a cloth mask: procedure masks do offer some level of incoming protection.  The N95s you got for the fires are not appropriate as they have breather valves, if you wear one of those, wear a cloth or blue-disposable over it.\n\nIf your parents or relatives want you home for the holidays, reply that you love them too much to risk it.  If they press further, say something like \"I give you a bowl of 200 M&Ms.  One will kill you.  One will cripple you.  Everyone over 40 gets to eat one if we have a family gathering.  Grandma needs to eat 5.  That is what happens if someone brings Covid to the family gathering.\"\n\nIt is going to be a dark end to a dark year.  But there is light ahead.  The multiple vaccine candidates are looking very very good, the distribution system is in place, and Pfizer alone is gearing up for a billion+ doses in the next several months and Pfizer is not the only one.

{"subreddit": "berkeley", "body": "An individual is suspected to have set fire to a memorial altar placed at Sather Gate by international students from Chinese territories, for victims who died in a residential fire in Xinjiang. As a result, part of Sather Gate, our campus landmark, now bears burn marks.\n\n[As seen on Wednesday](https://preview.redd.it/kxn4bsajfd3a1.jpg?width=1134&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc1fea1f25efe38b59cd0e352ead7b334f4dbeee)\n\nThe altar was placed there after a vigil was held on Monday night at Sather for the at least 10 victims who died in a fire in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Xinjiang, on November 24. Their death is the latest result of China\u2019s extreme \u201czero covid\u201d restriction, which bans people in certain areas from leaving their homes and buildings for months, and in many cases, authorities would even nail residential doors shut to physically bar people from going out.\n\nSo far, Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) \u201czero covid\u201d lockdown has deprived people of basic food access, denied escape routes from buildings when an earthquake affected a major city, turned non covid patients away from hospital care and led to their deaths, quarantined elderlies and disabled people in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, displaced migrant workers, and caused a bus accident which killed more than two dozens. In the case of the fire, firefighters were delayed for more than half an hour by lockdown roadblocks, and fire escapes inside the building were blocked. The victims either burned to their death or died by jumping out the windows of their burning apartments. Instead of launching an investigation or rethinking their extreme lockdown measures, officials blamed the residents for \u201chaving insufficient ability to save themselves\u201d and quickly censored relevant contents online. This incident has sparked rare protests and memorial vigils in major cities in China, not only demanding an end to the \u201czero covid\u201d policy, but also asking for systemic reform and democratic freedoms. Their demands are now being met with arrests and police crackdown within China, so Chinese students across U.S. campuses, including here in Berkeley, have in turn held memorial vigils for the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi fire victims and to stand with their fellow citizens in China.\n\nHowever, it has come to our attention on Tuesday night, that an exchange student from China who is in support of the CCP regime took to a group chat to brag about having set fire to the memorial alter and to Sather Gate, calling it a \u201cpurification\u201d of anti-CCP items. That message was sent at around 11:30pm on Tuesday night, and according to photos taken by fellow students, the burned marks on Sather Gate were already there by 10:30pm on the same night, and were also there to be found when we went to fact check this on Wednesday. Sather Gate was a gift to our campus more than a hundred years ago from Jane Sather, who was one of the earliest benefactors to UC Berkeley. The Gate is also a California Historical Landmark and listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n[Screenshot of Wechat group conversation + translation](https://preview.redd.it/pe3b7lssyi3a1.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d982f3fb1f79e334dbd5d933c2061861c4c52885)\n\nAs the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement, you are entitled to have and express opinions on campus, in ways that do not involve violence or recklessly setting fire to a historical landmark. This individual had not only sided with the totalitarian CCP regime to oppress his fellow citizens and disrespected the memory of the fire victims, he also doesn\u2019t seem to understand the consequences of arson or respect school property. We suggest that this individual come forward and apologize to the school and the student community for setting fire to our collective campus landmark, and to make necessary amends.\n\nThis is also a call for fellow Berkeley students to show compassion for each other\u2019s suffering and defend our community against this type of behavior. The family and friends of many international students who come from Chinese territories, including my own, are suffering from the extreme lockdown restrictions I have described above. There will be more future campus vigils and protests associated with what is taking place in China, so if you see us, please show your support when you have a minute to spare. Thank you!\n\n[Our memorial vigil scheduled for tonight \\(Thu\\) at Sather Gate at 8pm, for 7 days since the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi fire](https://preview.redd.it/mo7ybsqtfd3a1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d97040d09c47a4e5f690d66437bd322500ee7df9)\n\n \n\n**Edit:**\n\n**The moderator has requested that I remove all mention of this student\u2019s name for this post to stay up, so if you\u2019re new here, that is why his name is no longer mentioned. I am very grateful for the attention this has gotten, the very moved by support you all have shown in light of the tragedies and acts of courage taking place in China now. I must clarify that the intention is not for this to become a witch hunt to take this individual down, but for his actions to become an educational opportunity to raise awareness, because hunting down one inconsequential individual achieves very little. When Chinese/Hongkonger/Uyghur/Tibetan/Taiwanese student activists discuss politics on campus, the hostility we face mostly comes from those who look like us, speak our language, or hold the same passports as we do. It breaks my heart that they would rather stand with a totalitarian regime than with their own people. It\u2019s an everyday occurrence for us to get our posters ripped off promotion boards or have our banners stolen. However, setting fire to something of ours and blackening Sather Gate is a drastic and dangerous escalation, and my goal of putting this post out here is to make it clear to such people that this community will not tolerate this behavior, and that he has nothing to be proud of. Thank you all so much for your support!

{"subreddit": "berkeley", "body": "Just about a couple hours ago, the ICE(US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) released a new policy regarding international students.

This policy is both unreasonable, unrealistic, and extremely xenophobic imo.\n     First of all, it is nearly impossible to get an airplane ticket during this time, and even if you managed to find one, they are absurdly expensive (~$7000) More importantly, since the US has so many cases of COVID, countries like Vietnam already banned anyone(including their citizens)from the US to enter their borders.\n     Secondly, Some students like myself are from countries that are not suitable for online classes. Most  countries in Asia have huge time differences compared to the US. that means students have to wake up at 2,4 am everyday just to attend classes. Some countries like China blocks US networks, and some underprivileged countries don\u2019t even have internet access....\n    Finally, what even is the point of deporting international students? We are here legally and have done no harm to the economy. We had to pay full tuition for public schools like cal, and so many of us are in huge debt just to study and get a better life....I know that complaining about the government won\u2019t change anything, but this is just frustrating to the point where I had to rant about it here....I pray that all my fellow international students can stay strong and be united.", "title": "Serious rant from an incoming international student at cal", "id": "hmkg5c", "score": 1003, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/hmkg5c/serious_rant_from_an_incoming_international/", "permalink": "/r/berkeley/comments/hmkg5c/serious_rant_from_an_incoming_international/", "author": "bucciaratimaboi", "comments": [{"id": "fx5wrv8", "body": "It is an incredibly unreasonable and xenophobic policy, but that is the point.

There\u2019s a fire! Help!\u201d I heard my girlfriend shout.

So I ignored the fire and my girlfriend\u2019s pleas, and started writing out an academic integrity report before I could forget.\n\nBut all of a sudden, the smoke in my apartment cleared and the fire alarm fell silent. My girlfriend walked into the room, and to my astonishment, peeled off a wig and revealed herself to be Chancellor Khosla himself! \u201cIm proud of you for upholding and excelling Academic Integrity,\u201d he said, and gave me a $5 UC San Diego Bookstore gift card.

{"subreddit": "UCSantaBarbara", "body": "A friend who knows about my horrible experience pointed me to an article about Munger trying to build another windowless dorm at UCSB.\n\nDon't live there. Ever. Here are my thoughts after living in UM's Munger building in Ann Arbor for a few years:\n\n1) The \"close spaces\" forming bonding experiences is mostly BS. It was basically a blind-roommate situation where people mostly kept to themselves. People end up getting mad at each other for the normal stuff - not cleaning, leaving a mess, making too much noise, etc. It doesn't make you bond any more than a regular dorm experience.\n\n2) HOLY FUCKING SHIT THE WINDOWS. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who has a weird sleep schedule anyways. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who was frequently nocturnal. I thought it didn't matter to me as someone who enjoyed being alone anyways. I was so so so wrong. Going to bed and waking up in complete darkness everyday fucked with me so hard. After months of this I got to the point where I was snoozing for _3 hours_ and completely lacked the ability to get out of bed on some days. I didn't know when to get up or when to go to sleep and the days just started blurring together. I bought a sunrise alarm clock (one of those clocks that gradually brightens to simulate a sunrise). It didn't help. I made my alarms noisier and switched up the tones. It didn't help.\n\n3) They will try to win you over with nice furnishings and appliances and attractive \"living community\" spaces at an attractive price point. Don't be fooled. They are all very nice but if you are stuck in your bed, it won't matter. Also, the university jacked up rent far faster than inflation each year. I think inflation was around 2%/year when I was there but rates were going up 4-6% per year.\n\nThe architecture plan for The UCSB building looks even _worse_ than Michigan's. At UM, at least each \"suite\" of 6-7 rooms has a common area that has windows in it, so you can sit there to at least catch some daylight. The UCSB version looks like almost NONE of the suites _or_ rooms have access to windows.\n\n[This article](https://www.independent.com/2021/10/28/architect-resigns-in-protest-over-ucsb-mega-dorm/) states that\n\n> \u201cas the \u2018vision\u2019 of a single donor, the building is a social and psychological experiment with an unknown impact on the lives and personal development of the undergraduates the university serves.\u201d\n\nBut it has definitely been tested.

People came in and cussed me out when I told them I couldn\u2019t help them if they didn\u2019t have a mask. I don\u2019t make this rule. The company doesn\u2019t make this rule.

(I really don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind this one tbh)\n\n3. I went outside to take the order of someone without a mask because it was slow and I felt like being nice. This person proceeded to take their food without paying, and I had to chase them down and bring them back to the store to ask them to pay. \n\n4. A large group of friends had a ketchup packet war. They saw me staring and stopped. One girl out of the huge group said sorry -and then they all left. They didn\u2019t bother to pick up the mess they made. \n\n5. Multiple people came in after closing, after I had closed all the doors, put out the closed signs, and mopped the floors. I had to mop again and wipe down everything they touched. (Some of these people were upset that I didn\u2019t make an exception for them and take their orders. They rolled their eyes at me and said things about me as I reclosed the doors.)\n\nAll the people that were involved in ALL of these things were college students. 18-27 years old.

Bear with me, as it\u2019s a string of words written through tears. \n\nThis morning around 8 am Big Boy crossed the rainbow bridge.  For the last 24 hours he was barely eating or drinking. Without going into graphic detail, I woke up at 6 am to him very sick.\nHe sat in my lap and had a calm moment before I called AVS (emergency vet) to let them know we were on our way. Once there they found him dehydrated, with low vitals, and an ultrasound showed a mass in his abdomen. Please know if I thought it was right or fair to put him through any further poking or prodding I would have. \n\nHe was calm and loved right to the very end. He was not alone. He left his body with words of love in his ears and tender chin scratches. \n\nShare your pictures. Share your stories. Heal from the loss by sharing how much he meant in this community. \n\nIf you feel so inclined to donate in his memory, ASAP Animal Shelter Assistance Program has a special donations fund for senior cats called the Alexandra Fund. I will be doing so on January 17th in honor of Big Boy and Betty.  They both gave us so much joy, I couldn\u2019t think of a better time. (Be sure to direct it to the old guys and gals. Senior cats are special earth angels.)\n\nI could say a million more things about how special Big Boy was, and how much his company meant to me over the years, but especially the last two. For now I will just be heartbroken. And extend my deepest gratitude and many thanks to everyone for all the support you provided over these super-senior years.\n\nRest In Peace Big Boy, the UCSB campus cat. \nYou did good buddy. \n~2005 - 1.12.22\"", "score": 193, "author": "lostdiscoball"}, {"id": "hsey60f", "body": "Dude lived 17+ years.

Here's my honest experience on it right now.\n\nI'm in Gaskko's class and while I don't know how her class used to be run in previous quarters because she changed it this quarter, I am struggling as well even after going to numerous lab hours. It's really been crushing my mental health and I've considered dropping the course even with a W.\n\nI've heard she was a really good professor and she definitely knows her coursework well, but she is difficult to understand at times. The TAs try to make up for this by making lectures be online videos with captions, but even that is questionable at times. One lecture video she announces that the answer to a problem was B and the caption said D meaning the TAs couldn't even tell and then people in the course discord were all confused on what she said. It's just one small case, but just goes to show it's an issue.\n\nPersonally I struggle with the homework the most. I don't understand why it's so difficult for me because I don't see too many people complain about it on the discord, except for a few people. I'm seriously questioning if it was a problem with myself or with the class. The problems typically ask questions that aren't necessarily taught in the ZyBooks because the ZyBooks are pretty surface level and sometimes the method to solve the questions are pulled from the in-lecture activity, but I feel like whatever we're given in the course material just isn't enough. It feels like the questions are meant to be taught through an instructor or LA to teach you how to intuitively think outside the box, not struggle with on your own. It's possible if you go to LA for every question you might have, but sometimes that's difficult if your schedule is busy and doesn't line up. I am truly appreciative of how many lab hours and office hours are offered in this course though, but it feels like a necessity to pass the class for me.\n\nThankfully I like other parts of the course which in generous in the points they give like completing zybooks and lecture video quizes. The midterms aren't as difficult either because they're meant to be a step down from the in-lecture activities, but personally due to how to course is structured I feel like I'm missing more practice in the fundamentals rather than niche cases that I have to look back to the in-lecture activity or lab hours for. The idea is to get the student to really understand the course material on the deep level, but I feel like the course structure or class isn't set up to do a great job at that with the questions and lecture material there is.\n\nAs for Nicolau's comment, it is completely unacceptable. I hope he gets the appropriate discipline and their attempt to cover it up as a \"typo\" is **embarrassing**.

The TL;DR is that the issue might be due to a confluence of the pandemic and the way one of the lines in your email may have been misread (tone-wise). \n\nI\u2019m not in ICS, but as a grad TA in another department, I have been absolutely appalled by how some (not all!) students treat us now when it comes to grading. I get a flood of emails complaining any time I give someone less than a perfect grade on something \u2014 even emails for things like not giving someone who didn\u2019t speak participation points (um, duh?), or refusing to accept an assignment two weeks after the deadline because a kid decided to \u201cfocus on other classes\u201d for a while. Every time, the response I get from students is basically, \u201cWell, I should get credit because I tried my best!\u201d Or something to that effect. (And I\u2019m saying this as someone who is a very lenient TA with deadlines and grading; trust me, if you have a real crisis or even just a bad mental health day, I give you extensions.) \n\nBasically, adjusting to post-pandemic life has simply not happened for a chunk of the student population. Most of you are wonderful and get me excited to teach each day; some of you seem to think that logging into Zoom for half the class should be an A, and deadlines are irrelevant.\n\nI say this because here\u2019s where I think your email went wrong (for me, at least): your complaint about homework. Up until that point, your criticisms were all valid (if true; I don\u2019t know the professor, but am taking what you say at face value). But then you go on this thing about being appalled that your homework is being graded on correctness. Not to be a jerk, but \u2026 how is that unfair? A degree is not (or at least, in my opinion, should not solely be) a participation trophy. Right answers do exist in the world and do matter. If you\u2019re coding my website, I care that you do it right, not just that you tried your best. Getting a degree in a subject certifies that you have mastered that content. Your professor has no obligation to give you full credit on homework if you are not demonstrating mastery of the content. *As a TA, I reward effort a lot in my grading, but it still matters that people also get stuff right.*\n\nSo all this is to say, I\u2019m sorry you got the response you did. I think your criticisms of that professor, if true, sound valid. I think it may have come across as entitled when you began to be concerned about not getting perfect grades on homework, and I think you need to understand that we (TAs, professors, etc.) are dealing with a ton of entitled people who are saying that to us on a daily basis, so you may have hit a nerve.", "score": 30, "author": "elosohormiguero"}, {"id": "ja97nb4", "body": "horrible response from the professor but your email skills def need some work as well", "score": 69, "author": "sushjens"}, {"id": "ja8u8wv", "body": "It\u2019s definitely unprofessional of them.

{"subreddit": "UCI", "body": "**TLDR: ASUCI students did not cancel Summerlands, the school\u2019s professional staff canceled it over fixable and preventable concerns. $200k and hundreds of student hours down the drain. No in-person concerts have been allowed to happen since February of 2020, which is a disgrace. We need an engaged student body that fights for genuine student control over the time/money we have devoted to UCI. If you are a student interested in taking further action please reach out to me and let\u2019s strategize; we need all the support we can get from you right now.**\n\nDear UCI Student Body,\n\nI am one of two ASUCI Concert Commissioners and I want you all to know the truth that **THE CANCELLATION OF SUMMERLANDS WAS COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE**, and why ASUCI professional staff and the structure of student government, not individual students or commissions, are to blame. This story is not intended to get tears and hugs from the students, but rather to give you all an accurate understanding of what really went on behind the scenes throughout this year-long ordeal. I hope that you all can channel your anger towards the UCI governance structure as we proceed with some sort of student measure to hold the administration accountable.\n\n**My Intro**\n\nI have wanted to join the ASUCI concert commission since freshman year of APAD and finally got the opportunity to become an intern last year. This year I was interviewed to become a co-commissioner/co-head for this branch, and have co-led it since last summer. I\u2019ve met incredible people like my co-head and commission interns who have taught me so much about building a strong work ethic, and I became more passionate about concerts as we put more time into planning them. Before this year, I felt a similar yearning for concerts to be better, especially during the first year of COVID, and I had believed that ASUCI was apathetic to student concerns when things went wrong. Unfortunately, I realized that while imperfect, the student leaders of ASUCI do not hold as much power in decision making at UCI as it may seem.\n\n**APAD - First Conflict**\n\nMy commission came into this fall incredibly excited about facilitating APAD for the student body, the first irl concert in two-years. We were going to help bring back the live music scene and help the student body connect with each other again. As you all know, the year started quite scary, with students coming back to campus infected and spikes in the virus happening around SoCal. APAD had been planned for Welcome Week, but the under the infuriatingly limited paramaters the school imposed upon us, we knew that the event would quickly turn into a super-spreader event. Despite the concert heads\u2019 pleads for social distancing and mask requirements, our VP at the time was unwilling to work with us to make the concert safe, suggesting that we cram upwards of 5,000 maskless students into one big crowd to intermix for multiple hours. After multiple exhausting fights with him and a not so supportive team of professional staff, they finally allowed us to postpone the concert to the beginning of Winter Quarter, so that it could happen in person. We then spent much of the fall quarter re-planning the entirety of the event. January rolled around and to everyone\u2019s surprise, a new spike in omicron cases caused Winter Quarter to be virtual for the first few weeks, forcing us to make APAD virtual. We were absolutely heartbroken by this situation imposed upon us, but we  tried to work within our restrictions to add some interactive components to the event, including meet n greet opportunities, q&a, etc. All of which seem simple but elements we had to fight hard for.\n\n**Racism and \u201cHouse 949\u201d**\n\nThere was supposed to be a NEW  concert slated for the middle of Winter Quarter dedicated solely to hip-hopcalled \u201cHouse 949.\u201d Our team poured a lot of effort into building this entire event out from scratch and were very excited to be putting this on for the student body. During this planning process just a few months before the event,  the full-time adult staff of ASUCI informed us they could not approve any of the artists we selected and cited racist reasons for doing so. Invoking how the Shocktoberfest floor-seat hopping incident was incited by a Black hip-hop artist (without recognizing how they limited floor-seats by a huge capacity compared to previous concerts), they used phrases that insinuated that the hip-hop genre brings a lot of trouble to our campus, how artists had to be approved through UCIPD, there was a longer vetting process for artists of this genre, and expressed disturbing concern for the types of crowds this genre of music  may bring. The list goes on. This debate was also happening around the time the Astroworld tragedy took place, which made it easy for administration to allege that all hip-hop concerts end up like this. At one point after fighting back, they had us write down two sentences per hip-hop artist to justify why they weren\u2019t \u201cproblematic.\u201d No matter what we did to fight back, they decided this concert wasn\u2019t going to happen because of \u201csafety.\u201d\n\n**Sabotage from our Student Services Vice President**\n\nFrom summer to winter quarter, we were also forced to endure [a corrupt and emotionally abusive ASUCI Student Services Vice President named Joshua Ma](https://www.newuniversity.org/2022/02/07/asuci-vice-president-of-student-services-joshua-ma-resigns/) who mismanaged the planning of successful events for everyone. He put us through a lot of hardship by being manipulative, power-hungry, disregarding and undermining our work, spreading rumors about other ASUCI members and attempting to pit us against each other, etc. He was also the reason a lot of our events were canceled or postponed, due to poor planning on his part. It was not uncommon that he would say he would do things, not do them, lie about doing them, and then force us to pick up his slack, forcing us to scramble. After the other commissioners in the student services office finally came together towards the end of fall quarter and recognized how unfit he was as our leader, we put together an internal review, demanding him to resign to enable an ASUCI SSVP responsible to the student body.\n\nDespite how damaging his leadership was to us, we continued to push forward to put together a good Summerlands for all of you, our last chance for an in-person concert before the end of the year. We worked diligently to ensure the success of this event for more than 5 long months. This concert was very restrictive in terms of budget, as Joshua had [siphoned $120,000 of the money from concert comission right before he left office](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/s0vj1h/article_on_asuci_election/hs4s6nv/). We were not thoroughly debriefed/educated on this transfer, and neither was the senate. We believe Joshua Ma had transferred this money in retaliation for us forcing him to resign. As Concerts Commission bore the brunt of his abuse, our testimonies were instrumental in removing him, thus why this retaliation would make sense. We hoped to use this fund towards Summerlands to secure more for the students or maybe even better artists but pro-staff believed this money that was allocated for the winter concert did not need to be put towards Summerlands because they said our budget already had enough money to accomplish a good concert. We did not want just a good concert, we wanted the best concert possible with all the funding possible to make up for the past virtual ones.\n\n**Summerlands Planning**\n\nDesite the limitations we for Summerlands, we incorporated new elements such as a 4 artist lineup, ASL interpreter, and new ADA-approved accommodations to make sure as many people as possible could enjoy it, whether they knew the artists or not. Finally, we had secured a very well known artist for the headliner (I can\u2019t expose their name due to NDA, but they are quite popular atm), only for them to drop out of the event two weeks before the event. By then, we unfortunately only had limited options to secure a headliner, a process that takes a couple of months. Throughout the entire time I was in this commission, we were never given information on artists\u2019 contracts or why they often sign them so late (days before the event) but we always had a feeling we were being deceived because we had seen other schools releasing line-ups much earlier than just a few days before the event.\n\n**SUMMERLANDS WAS NOT CANCELLED BY ASUCI STUDENTS**\n\nComing in to Summerlands yesterday: It was finally happening! we secured a new headliner and all contacts were finally signed.We were able to release the artist to the public a few days before the concert. Despite the thousands of negative comments from many of the students, we were relieved we would even be able to have an in-person concert again after the thousands of hurdles and limited budget.\n\nNervous but excited, we came to the venue on the morning of the event bright and early to set up, prepare goodies for attendees, add last-minute details in, etc. We quickly got alarming news from one of the pro-staff members that because of the drizzle of rain the night before, they were thinking of cancelling the event. I took it very lightly at first, thinking there would be no way a whole entire concert with [a little over $200,000 budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18nR-rod3OZOzYOYjNgE1oQS2wdmCH2u3kAr0qSUWFuY/edit#gid=0) would be cancelled. Yes, the stage was absolutely soaked, and some of the stage equipment were damaged, but we assumed that ASUCI professional-staff (who are responsible for the stage logistics, and students are not allowed to participate in this process to hold them accountable even if we had tried) would take it upon themselves to force the external logistics vendor to figure out a solution by the show\u2019s start. We continued with our day trying to finish every possible detail of the event. At around 11 am that morning, my co-head and I got pulled into the office and informed that the show had been cancelled and we could do nothing about it. We froze in utter shock and fear\u2026\n\nAfter processing what we were hearing, we went to speak to one of the pro-staff members, who explained their completely illogical rationale to cancel the event. We pleaded with them, showing that the weather forecast showed no rain expected for the rest of the day at all. He looked me right in the eyes and informed me that the decision had already been made by the directors and that it was thesafest thing to do. After trying to argue back, I was on the verge of tears right in front of him while he told us we needed to draft an email to the school. My co-head and I left the room sobbing and feeling helpless. I called another staff member just to be told the same thing again, and the director who was the ultimate decision-maker was not in sight or reachable. Students were not consulted, only told the news after agents and everyone had already been contacted. The concert was cancelled without our consent.\n\nShortly after, professional staff attempted to force us to set up a booth outside to distribute merch to the students, something we did not have the mental capacity to do while sobbing and trying to process. My commission\u2019s year-long work, the $200,000 budget for the concert, and all of the UCI student\u2019s eager hopes were disregarded and thrown away by the professional staff in an instant because they didn\u2019t want to \u201crisk\u201d equipment getting damaged by the potential rain (which we knew wouldn\u2019t happen, and didn\u2019t happen). The worst part is that the professional staff could have just looked at the forecast a few weeks ago and ordered rain-proof equipment, but instead they cheaped-out and allowed for equipment that shorted out in the drizzle. They could have protected the stage from rain better. There are specific members on the ASUCI professional staff who have displayed an absolute inhumanity and self-service that has enabled the mistreatment of my commission, locked students out of critical decision-making, essentially lit hundreds of thousands of student fees on fire, and then in the end tell us the concert could not have happened due to some very limited liability concerns of equipment getting damaged in the rain.I am furious because this was unfair to every single one of us on campus and ABSOLUTELY PREVENTABLE.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAt the end of the day, students are the face of this office to the rest of the school, but I wish more people knew what type of abuse of power goes on behind the scenes, and that professional staff actually run a majority of the show. The concert commission does get to help pick out artists, the amenities that students receive, the marketing direction, etc.; but the logistics and actual setup of the event is mostly managed by professional staff. I get 80 dollars deposited into my bank account every 2 weeks while working 15+ hours per week towards concerts, just to be given no choice in the final outcome. I understand student frustration, but it is very reactionary for students to continue to blame commissioners for a \u201cfailure of leadership\u201d without recognizing we don\u2019t have control over many processes at UCI, Summerland\u2019s cancellation included. **I hope this post clears it up for you all.** In order for students to actually get the events they deserve, we need more decision making power at ASUCI. There is nothing that morning that would have made us want to cancel an event we put our blood, sweat, and tears into for so many months had it not been the administration who forced us to do so. If we had more control over funding priorities, the show absolutely would\u2019ve went on. This was something taken away from all of us, and I hope students start to direct that blame on to the people who get bankrolled by our student tuition, do not care about following through with events, exploit their student workers, and turn around and put us on the face of it all to deflect the blame every year. Go ahead and talk to the ASUCI professional staff (there are some very wonderful people on the staff who tried their best, but the leadership is rotten), and you will see that they really do not care about us and always defer to the UCI leadership at the top.\n\n**Call to Action**\n\nI want to apologize for you all only getting this critical background now, but please remember that UCI has an oppressive governance structure that represses any sort of dissent against their self-serving rule. The students deserve so much more than a few dollars refund for no in-person concerts this year. Although the concerts commission is hurt by the avalanche of negative comments, we recognize that students\u2019 frustration has been misguidedly pointed at ASUCI students rather than the root cause of the problem, ASUCI professional staff. There are no hard feelings between us and students, hopefully you all can channel your anger towards UCI as we proceed with something to hold the administration accountable. I hope people finally understand the truth so we can take appropriate action, and I dream of building an engaged student body that pushes for actual student control over the time and money we pour into this campus. I call on the student body to push for some platform of radical demands that fundamentally changes the governance structure of ASUCI. **If you are a student interested in taking further action please reach out to me and let\u2019s strategize; we need all the support we can get from you right now.**\n\nIn Solidarity, Anika Tasnim, ASUCI Concerts Co-Comissioner\n\n[**My Instagram Post**](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd2b_YOumIH/)\n\nSide note:[ A fabricated post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/uusduq/from_within_asuci/) was made by a person pretending to be an ASUCI concert commissioner a few hours ago.

I hope to provide some history and context to the situation. \n\n**UCI Hates Lawsuits** \n\nUCI has a lot of ambition as a school and cares significantly to climb university rankings. This has caused Administration to care a lot about anything that can potentially negatively impact the reputation of UCI. This has caused the university to adopt many policies to avoid any potential lawsuits. What this means if anything has even a small potential to result in a lawsuit they will avoid it like the plague. For this reason, the administration kills anything that could lead to a lawsuit no matter how ridiculous it is. That little rain that fell on the equipment from the administration's standpoint the sheer potential of damage from it and the potential of anything going wrong with it was more than enough for the admin to kill it. In short, the admin rather kill a 200,000-dollar concert than face a lawsuit for millions and that can drag UCI's reputation through the mud.  Student enjoyment of a concert probably was not considered. If you wonder why UCI does anything the way they do it's probably because they recognized a potential lawsuit somewhere. \n\n**Prostaffs role** \n\nRegarding Prostaff I will not defend any racism expressed or coldness expressed they should be held fully accountable for that. Prostaff works more as enforcers of UCI Administration and practical management of ASUCI. What does this mean? They can offer advice on ASUCI-related things but as long as UCI admin and their legal team doesn't say no to things because of some policy somewhere their advice can be ignored. What this means is that if the admin or legal say no they act as the messenger of that regardless of how they feel.  \n\n**Prostaff and CRs**\n\nAs to specific members of prostaff and connections to College republicans at UCI I can confirm they are nonexististant. Few of the members of the college republicans actively worked against prostaff and I actually heard some of them express plans to try and remove them from their positions obviously that never happened. Prostaff had no power to stop them from many actions like I said before if ASUCI's actions do not conflict with policy they can not say no and their advice can be ignored. In CRs case they ignored prostaffs advice all the time. Many of CRs actions actually were stopped because it conflicted with policies such as the infrastructure acts. \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nLook UCI policies need to be reformed many of their policies are obstructing the student experience and the admin seems completely fine with that. I made this post just in case any students seeking to reform admin or their policy have some important context. Whether that happens or not or any reform happens I am pessimistic it will happen but I hope it does. \n\nTo the Concert commissioners, my deepest sympathies.

What if other universities have more restrictions or the same restrictions? You need way more context surrounding hosting events across different universities to deem the restrictions faced at UCI unreasonable.\n\nI totally buy the rationale for cancelling the hip hop event especially surrounding the Astroworld incident. In our hyper aware media environment, I can understand why the staff is super concerned about approving an event that can get them on the news in a negative light. I think it's dumb but that's the world we live in now.\n\nYou state that the rain incident could've been prevented if the staff have just looked up the forecast weeks before the event, why didn't any of you bring that up LOL How much were the damages to the equipment? If y'all were so confident that the remaining equipment wouldn't get damaged, why not tell the staff we will personally handle the payment of any damage to the equipment. If I was a staff member I would agree, assuming that would be legal to do LOL\n\nIt does feel here y'all did drop the ball haha. From the perspective of the staff, I can understand why they would cancel. I don't think it is wrong that they didn't consult the ASUCI group for approval, after all it sounds like the final say always comes from the staff which should probably be the case. \n\nI don't believe the staff did anything malicious or wrong. It's unfortunate the event got cancelled. It's wrong people are putting all the blame on the ASUCI kids. It's also wrong to try to blame the staff.

Yes, you read that correctly. It is completely impossible for me to move a question from one quiz to another in CANVAS. Caveat: it's possible if you pull questions from a \"Question Bank\", if you created one... which is great... but get this... if I have a question in a Quiz but not in the question bank... there is no way to copy it from the Quiz INTO a question bank!!!! So, if you're an instructor like me and you created the quizzes before you knew about CANVAS question banks... you're fucked. It's almost inconceivably stupid that CANVAS doesn't offer this functionality... but I've come to expect this kind of stupid shit from CANVAS. Sometimes I can't even edit a question after I've created it, even though there's an edit button (clicking the edit button often has no effect, whether in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox). I can't even cut-and-paste a question. The only way to move a question from one quiz to another (or put it into a question bank) is to manually create it in the other quiz and manually type the entire question again into the editor. So, yes, sometimes a question has a small error in it... but we can't fix it. Period. Because CANVAS fucking sucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The truth is that, unless you intend to go to grad school, your grades don't matter anywhere near as much as you probably think. If you learn the material... great. Most employers won't ask to see your transcript, so long as you have the degree. So whether you got 5 or 6 out of 11 on the quiz doesn't matter in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>When you complain to me about minor quibbles like the above, it eats away at my time so that it's hard for me to get to the important topics\u2014like students who work on Fridays and genuinely cannot take the quiz at the normal time on Friday and I have to arrange a different time for them. These students have a genuine worry--missing an entire quiz. Most other complains are trivial by comparison.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So... bottom line... I'll go through the long list of emails in my but I may choose to ignore it even if your complain has some merit in an ideal world.

{"subreddit": "CSULA", "body": "I understand that you have a job to do. I understand that the job sucks.\n\nThat being said, if you are one of the people roaming the campus with clipboards trying to get me to sign something, you need to chill the fuck out. There are too many of you running around hounding students for signatures. I also see that some of you are getting more aggressive with it, so consider this a FAQs for all of you:\n\n**\"Are you registered to vote?\"**\n\nYes, I am registered to vote, but you will never know it, because I will lie to each and every one of you to get you out of my face. It's much easier than telling you \"No\" 5 times, which is usually what it takes.\n\n**\"I'm petitioning to [insert cause here] and I can really use your help!\"**\n\nOn the off-chance that you're able to string together enough words to make an intelligible pitch that doesn't sound like you're trying to sell me a car, I'm still not going to sign, because your entire strategy of soliciting students while they're eating/studying/relaxing is intrusive, aggressive, and borderline harassment. If your employer didn't set up a spot for you to chill and gather signatures from people who were interested enough to ask, go back to your employers and tell them to stop being cheap. And if they told you that it was okay to circle the eating areas like vultures, you're welcome to post the name of the organization that sent you, their contact info, and their lunch hours so I can spam them with that same bullshit.\n\n**\"Come on! It'll only take a minute!\"**\n\nFirst of all, it never takes a minute. I know this because as soon I agree to sign something, you're going to pull five more clipboards out of your ass for me to look at. Second, if the conversation ever gets to the point where a simple \"No\" isn't enough to get you to leave me alone, you've crossed a line. This post is already way too long for me to get into all the aggressive, inappropriate shit that some of you do to coerce people into signing your stuff, so I'll keep it simple: If I say no, it fucking means no. Walk.
