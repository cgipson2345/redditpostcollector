{"subreddit": "ucmerced", "body": "Hey hope you all are having a great day.\n\nI'm stuck between UC Merced and UC Santa Cruz mainly because UC Merced is much cheaper. I got into UCM for Computer Science and Engineering and got into UCSC for Computer Science. I wanted to be a game developer but chose computer science to broaden my job opportunities and I know there are some issues with the game dev industry.\n\nSome pros I found for UCM are the student-to-faculty ratio, new facilities, the clubs, and the small population. But some cons are that the food and location suck. The food was on the news for how bad it was, but it seemed better when I visited. I don't plan on leaving campus much but I imagine the location makes it hard to find job opportunities. Their Computer Science also isn't ranked that high compared to the other UCs. As far as game development I saw that UCM has a game development club, game jams, and a course in game programming. UCM is also a growing school so it'll only get better.\n\nSome pros for UCSC are the close proximity to silicon valley for job opportunities, the beautiful campus, and the computer science is ranked a bit higher. Their game development program is also highly ranked. The cons I see are the cost and how hard it is to get housing. My friends are also going to UCM, two of which are doing the same major as me, while at UCSC I'd have no one. \n\nSo for UC Merced, what are the job opportunities like for Computer Science?

Most professors* at research universities are hired and promoted primarily based on our productivity as researchers.  That's also the case at UCM.  But!  In my experience the professors here care a lot more about teaching than at other research universities.  I'm constantly adjusting my classes each time I teach them, trying to help students understand difficult concepts and experimenting with classroom activities and assignments.  There's no class where I just show up and read off the same lecture slides yet again.  \n\n* There's a difference between professors and lecturers.  Your writing course and probably some other lower-division courses will be taught by lecturers, who are technically hired on contract to teach certain classes each semester.

A lot of it depends on you esp in CSE, so unlike other majors your school specifically doesn't make much of a difference(this is one of the reasons I picked Merced over UIUC).    \n\n\nMost professors care a lot about your education but classes are not necessarily the most rigorous compared to other schools(im comparing in general not UCSC I don't know about how their classes are). That being said most are willing to go above and beyond if you go to office hours and more.  I will say for game dev specifically UCSC is more known, however people's interests can change. A friend of mine was dead set on Game-Dev but now they've moved over to do AI/ML stuff.   \n\n\nJob Opportunities: It all depends on you! I've been luckily enough to get 2 CS internships(one at Nasa this summer, and one last year at SAP) and I know some other people have gotten some good ones, but again its all on you.

You see, I\u2019m from a conservative area near San Diego and I happen to be a staunch conservative. I'm also a registered Republican.\n\nI believe in small, limited government; limited interference in the private sector and deregulation, i.e. free markets; pro-life policy; supporting the NRA and gun rights; the fact that climate change claims are way overblown; not being ashamed of my heritage; lowered taxes; curbing illegal immigration; and putting America First, etc.\n\nI\u2019m also an avid listener of podcasts and shows hosted by Ben Shapiro (my favorite), Steven Crowder, Dennis Prager, Michael Knowles, Andrew Klavan, Charlie Kirk, Jordan Peterson\u2026 the list goes on and on.\n\nNow, given that my views are right-wing, my question is: If I wore t-shirts to class and around campus that with messages such as, \"Facts don\u2019t care about your feelings\u201d or \u201cReagan Bush \u201884\u201d or \u201cSocialism Sucks\u201d or a \u201cCapitalism\u201d but in the style and font of the 'Coca-Cola' logo, would I be attacked for my views? Would I be singled out, scorned or ostracized by students who can\u2019t stand the fact that someone disagrees with their left-wing worldview? In other words, I refer to the hard line leftists who are common on every college campus -- the type of students who draw consistently on either emotion or logical fallacy instead of air-tight, sound arguments to present their positions like most on the right. You all know who I'm talking about, the students who tend to major in gender studies, ethnic studies or sociology. Now, I'm not insulting those fields; rather, I'm merely saying that they tend to attract individuals with particular political inclinations. I also believe these fields help entrench these extreme left-wing views in students. Simply, I want to know if these individuals will give me hard time for my openly conservative views.\n\nI also ask because I tend not to shy away from correcting liberal professors when they try to proselytize their left-wing socialist views in class. I did it all through high school and was known as the kid who wouldn\u2019t back down from an intellectual scuffle with my leftist teachers. At one point I even had to have a mediation in the vice-principal's office with my AP government teacher who couldn\u2019t get over the fact that I didn\u2019t buy his \u201ctax cuts are terrible for the economy myth.\" This was after it got pretty heated one day between us in class. Long story short, I agreed to no longer bring my \u201cliberal tears\u201d coffee mug to class every morning lest I set him off again, haha. But boy, was he full of rhetoric and baseless arguments. It was honestly kind of sad. It\u2019s just too bad my peers didn\u2019t see it. I actually should've kept quiet most of the time because I ran the risk of being graded unfairly and thus risking my position as one of my school's valedictorians. Luckily, it wasn't an issue. But the fact that I had to worry about it at all tells you a lot about the state of left-wing bias in schools these days: it's everywhere, especially in colleges.\n\nAnyway, I would just like to know what kind of an experience a proud conservative freshman would have, given these viewpoints and predilections. Based on the fact that UCLA is the top public university in the nation and attracts bright students, I don\u2019t expect to encounter many (if any) students who would do anything drastic, but you can never be too safe. Even schools like Yale have leftists who scram at professors and get away with it. That\u2019s why I inquire opinions on how the political climate is at the moment and what I can expect in the fall.\n\nAlso, how\u2019s the Republican club on campus? I honestly can\u2019t wait to join. Btw, if any kooky far-leftists are reading this: get ready because UCLA is about to produce another Ben Shapiro. \ud83d\ude09 You\u2019ve been warned, lol.

Most of the graduates were at *3+ to 4 years* in attaining 180(+) units in spring of 2022, and additionally in attaining the units to satisfy their major(s), and were in the high-school graduating cohort of 2018, meaning that's when they entered UCLA, which would be right around four years in completing their degrees. This was 54.4% of the entire graduating class which included transfers, and of just those who entered from high school they were 87% of the graduating class. This doesn't mean that 87% graduated in four years; that number was 84.5% who took their degrees at the max of four years (again, of those who entered from HS and from the 2018 cohort).\n\nThe question, as related to what you're asking could be: How would that 3.59 average at graduation for the whole class relate just to life-science/bio grads? Most of the grads are in Letters & Science (L&S) and Bio is in L&S. As related to [Latin Honors](https://registrar.ucla.edu/registration-classes/graduation/final-degree-audit/honors) which is calculated to the thousandth in gpa and awards these three honors to the top 20% of the graduating class, L&S would be somewhere in the middle of all of UCLA's colleges and schools in ascendant gpas. But, again, L&S is the largest of colleges, and there are a good number of Bio students at UCLA, so it would appear that Bio majors could or should uphold the \\~3.59 average. But then, it could actually be higher because if a group of students maintain a lower gpa in their first couple of years, they may opt out of Bio and switch to, say, the social sciences.\n\nAssuming the points above are relatable, if you factor in Latin Honors into the mix (and LH is calculated to the thousandth of gpa), a good 20% of Bio majors would have \u2265 3.881 (3.88) gpa at graduation, per the lowest gpa of Cum Laude honors for L&S. This would seemingly imply, assuming a normal curve, that the 70th percentile grads would have \u2265 3.80 gpa, and it might dip to \\~ 68th percentile. But the average for Bio-related majors could be higher than the class average too as per above, as Bio majors could be majorly culled. So I'd say that a good 1/3 of the graduating Bio Sciences class would have at least a 3.8 gpa.\n\nIt doesn't appear that UCLA has grade deflation but it wouldn't have the inflation that is seemingly seen at some of the Ivy colleges.", "score": 6, "author": "noclouds82degrees", "page_title": "Reddit - Dive into anything"}, {"id": "jd72c74", "body": "No, grading has been fair from my experience, if not inflated.

Much of this wont make sense now, but I recommend you save it as it will later on when you register.  You will prolly need GE's for some quarters. Again, check on bruinwalk to look at ratings and try to get an easy GE as your third class. UCLA pre-med courses are way easier than many think. You have plenty of spare time to do other things so as long as you don't get too distracted, you'll be fine. I'm a freshman rn so that's all I have to offer.\n\nExtracurricular wise, there's not much you're able to do Freshman year. Nevertheless, with the things you're able to do, start looking early. Try to register as a volunteer or a scribe early so sometime fall of 2023. That way you have something lined up by Spring the following year. Also, look into a pre-med frats and clubs; they don't just do volunteering. They also give you connections to powerful ppl who can hook you up with opportunities. Start early though. Fall is the best chance at getting in as they are all very competitive and tend to be more unforgiving in the winter/spring.\n\nWith regards to looking for roommates, I would look on Instagram. I honestly wouldn't stress too much abt roommates.  I went with random and am good friends with my roommate. The majority of ppl tend not to have major problems with roommates but then again there's a chance (little albeit) you end up with a weirdo.

I think its popularity exits because grads from the major are doing well in whatever business sector they're seeking, consulting, banking, marketing, etc. -- although most who want marketing major in things like Communication or even Sociology. Unfortunately, upper-level banking is mainly a male domain, and marketing is mainly female, at least at UCLA, but not to leave out those who identify with neither or both gender(s).\n\nThere will be some who say these numbers lag behind UCB Haas and other universities that have undergrad b-majors, but most of the upper-tier universities don't have an undergrad b-major.\n\nif UCLA students put themselves out there, by joining clubs and taking numerous internships, etc., then they'll have the same opportunities as Haas grads, but UCB students hype Haas like no other which leads to much of its blind following. Additionally, gaining internships will often be a function of scholarship in the classes students have taken as well as whom one knows, which is why being in a frat or sorority will help with ins and connections in various b-sectors.\n\nAlso, some complain that UCLA's business-related clubs are too exclusive, but that would be anywhere. However, there are clubs like the Undergraduate Business Society,  largest club on campus, which will take anyone as will Bruin Real Estate Association (BREA), which is mainly more for those interested in commercially based RE. These will have meetings and newsletters to give students notice.\n\nAs to what u/studson721 stated, the graduate-based management schools at many schools offer undergrads the opportunity to *transfer* into an undergrad business major, some with concentrations. UCLA's management school, the Anderson School of Management (ASM), has chosen to detach itself from the University, but it offers undergrads [various courses](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=management) as the *business*, or management, side of the Business Economics major.\n\nThe [Economics](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=economics) side would have the typical macro- /microeconomics and econometrics, but the department has added courses almost yearly. I'm seeing some lower-div personal finance classes which weren't there before.  There are the 10 106A, B, ... V classes that offer things fairly outside of the typical economics offering.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of Economics, Business Economics, and Mathematics/ Economics majors are adding things like Statistics as a double or minor to their studies, and this is helping them become even more marketable. Econ and Bizecon are short to fairly short majors, so Stats is a good addition.\n\nSome are even adding a Specialization in Computing offering which has Java and Python, or some are now adding the Social Data Science or Data Science Engineering minors.\n\nThere are natural minors to the three majors, E, BE, ME, in Accounting and Entrepreneurship. But these two minors can be added to any major in any department, and I've heard of Sociology majors adding Accounting, and Communications, Biology, History majors, any major, adding Entrepreneurship.\n\nI've also heard of Bizecon majors adding math, or just going with one of the various Mathematics majors. There are some who are getting jobs at PwC or Deloitte who are majoring in Cognitive Science. So there are a lot of majors from which to choose to enter the various b-sectors . . . all the best.\n\nLet me add that there's a gpa threshold one needs for Bizecon, which is \\~ 3.3 or so in prereq courses.", "score": 6, "author": "noclouds82degrees", "page_title": "Course Descriptions | UCLA Registrar\u2019s Office"}, {"id": "jd4w94z", "body": "Varies widely depending on the course and the professor.

If this attitude is taken, then BE, E, ME, or pure Business wouldn't be \"cutting it\" on a pure educational and preparation standpoint because a BS/BA degree is more generally based instead having a narrow specificity as to a particular company/firm, which besides, would be impossible.\n\nThis is why internships in the all-encompassing sphere of business are so important. And that's why I've recommended that those who want to enter whatever business sector take as many internships as possible, even after this person graduates if needed, so that this student or grad can find one's calling and for the prospective employer to find the right employee fit on the firm's /company's side.\n\nAll I was saying for BE, E, or ME majors to do was to add some of these minors and concentrations to be able to fit whatever mold specific companies are seeking and to be armed with the tools that they provide.\n\nAdditionally, Economics and sometimes Accounting are very important coursework that pure business majors will include in their studies, and you'll find that they are required to take macro, micro and elementary accounting.\n\nThere are some economists who could foretell that banks and the markets would have trouble with the fed tinkering with rates and funds that came true wrt to the banks and hopefully won't come to pass wrt the markets, so an overview of economic conditions affecting one's firm/company is imperative.\n\nAnd accounting is essential for accounting, obviously, and for finance. There's a famous Reddit post called U See Lotsa Accountants, using the approximate acronym of the University written by, I'm guessing, a USC or UCB grad -- I don't know when it originated, but this person was denigrating what ASM and the Economics department were offering and that they were only preparing students for accounting. It was a stupid post because accounting is essential for the broad world of finance.\n\nAnyway, adding things like the DS minors, accounting, computing specialization, value investing, entrepreneurship, are to prepare BE, E, ME grads for the very broad world of business, and to help them to be marketable in various business sectors, more so that they could choose what field in which they want to be employed, not that specifically BE is particularly lacking and their having to add these courses. And the purpose of BE is not to get a job, but to get a really good one, which it enables those who major in it to do.\n\nI'd like to see UCLA add a marketing minor, and, say, house it in Communications. I'd like to see UCLA add a few RE classes, and a few more finance-related ones, but accounting is sufficient for this latter, as well as the 142 A-C classes. In fact these three classes were added because of student input, I believe.

QS is the world ranking that puts UCLA lowest at 44th, but it has UMich 25th, UCB, 27th, London School of Economics 56th, and Brown 63rd. QS is a British-based publication.\n\nOf the UCs, UCLA has the toughest standards of entry -- essentially the first public to have < 10% acceptance rate, and has a little better quality student than UCB wrt stats. The average uwgpa of freshmen was 3.93 in 2022 and 60% came in with a 4.0-straight-A average.\n\nThis is reflected in UCLA baccalaureates having an average gpa of 3.59 at graduation in 2021-22 the highest of all the UCs. What enables this is that UCLA is the most preprofessional of all the UCs, with more students who are looking to attend grad school.  \n\nThe University produces the most MDs of any school in the nation, and probably the most attorneys, and its grads who go into business & commerce are as qualified as any grads anywhere, because UCLA makes sure that they have an analytically based education, more math heavy than most other schools.

And yes, resources may be better reallocated toward avoiding the conditions of crime via investing also in stronger social programs. Yes, police training needs to be reworked to be more about community policing, rather than militarization of police; deescalation training, not viewing citizens as threats all the damn time, etc. Yes, yes yes; there are massive changes that need to be done throughout the whole system.\n\n2) The police did a good job here. I listened to the scanner for nearly 5 days straight. They were on top of that shit. They got tons of calls about suspicious behavior, possible sightings, etc, and they went to check each one as far as I could tell. They relied on the community, as you have to in situations like this, and acted professionally through it. They also sounded very tired, because indeed - they were working long shifts for several days straight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the press conference on FB, there was so much toxicity in the chat. People who, because they assume all police are inherently bad, worked backward to find reasons to criticize them.\n\n\\- No, they didn't go into all details about the evidence. They can't and shouldn't do that yet. This is fresh, and even \\*if they are fully 100% sure this is the person\\*, they should withhold evidentiary details until the prosecution comes into play. The evidentiary information they provided was more than we had before, but not much more than what was already public. I'm fairly certain, given their demeanor and responses, that they have much more on this person, but can't disclose it \\[they also explicitly said they can't discuss much more evidentiary info\\].\n\n\\- Yes, they did acknowledge the community support in this. They also responded to a ton of similar possible sightings throughout several days. They did a good job here.\n\n\\- Yes, they 'appear happy': They are, like many of us presumably, relieved that this person was caught. \n\n\\- Yes, it took several days to find the person. What do you expect to happen when searching for one person with a vague description in an active town? They aren't mind readers; this isn't minority report. They can't know who everyone is, where they are, and what they're doing. They also can't easily prevent crime for the same reason... no idea why people are saying that the PD \"shouldn't have allowed it to happen in the first place\"; again, this isn't minority report.\n\nTLDR: Glad this person was caught; the police seem relatively confident that this is the correct subject of interest.

In a survey we did of r/UCSD, 2/3 respondents agreed r/UCSD didn't represent UCSD's overall student body. \n\n# A few useful links:\n\n* [The New Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVRH3wrEK3RQ5OZ9cLyPYhzUTtlkNlxq5W9QEIr_CwM/edit?fbclid=IwAR3EwJJxHZsGClKT65_eI_C8a2vsp0yPtdOX9zH6K9he6SQ-vTVBgqJqsik)\n* [UCSD Incoming Student FAQ - The Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBOha62mF0onJOq-f5FuGR4MdNZDLZwhR1GnSrnA1es/edit)\n* Discord Servers\n   * [Class of 2027 Discord](https://discord.gg/HCPwmKhXgB)\n   * [Class of 2025 Discord]( https://discord.gg/6rGpBksv5S)\n   * Additional servers can be found through the [UCSD Discord Servers MegaDoc](https://ucsd.edu/go/discord) after getting your UCSD email. \n* [TritonLink](https://students.ucsd.edu/)\n* [UCSD Support](https://support.ucsd.edu/services)\n* [UCSD Admissions](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/)\n* [r/UCSD Copypasta Archive (need to start the meme indoctrination early)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/wiki/copypasta)\n* [4 Year Plans](http://plans.ucsd.edu)\n\nPlease be aware stuff at UCSD can change *fast*. Most info you can find on this subreddit will still hold true, but there were some major changes in 2020 (Sixth College has a brand new location, Seventh College exists where transfers used to live, transfers moved to a different area).\n\nEighth College is brand new for Fall 2023, with its housing still currently being under construction. As a result, we don't have as much specific info about it besides the GE requirements and the location. \n\n# How do I login to check my admissions decision?\n\nYou should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).\n\n# Can I switch to Computer Science? / I was accepted undeclared but I applied CS!:\n\nIf you were not accepted directly into CSE:CS or CSE:CE (not ECE:CE) and are dead set on being a CS major, you should not attend UCSD. Being admitted undeclared basically means you were accepted to UCSD, but the CSE department rejected your application. Switching into CS is now effectively impossible. The CSE department does not anticipate there being ANY slots for current UCSD students to switch into. More details can be found on the [CSE Capped Major Webpage](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse-capped-admissions-program). *Assume it will be impossible to switch into Computer Science if you were not directly admitted to the major.*\n\n~~Computer Engineering is a bit different, CSE CE and ECE CE are the exact same major requirements (only the advisors are different), but ECE CE is subject to the ECE capped major system (which is not a lottery but requires a high GPA in the screening courses) while CSE CE is subject to the CSE system. So if you are okay with CE instead of CS, you can try going for ECE:CE. It will still be challenging and is far from guaranteed.~~ \n\n[**EDIT: ECE CE WILL NO LONGER BE AN OPTION AND IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE AS WELL.** ](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/capped-major-status)\n\nIf you are set on UCSD but not set on CS, the [Computing Paths page](http://computingpaths.ucsd.edu/) lists other computing related majors that UCSD has such as Math-CS, Cognitive Science, Data Science, etc (but keep in mind these are NOT CS).\n\n# What does the college I got affect? Can I change college? \n\nFor freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.\n\nYour major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (Seventh to the future site of Eighth). \n\nYou cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable. \n\n# I'm waitlisted. What should I do next?\n\n[From UC San Diego Admission Website](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/first-year/application-timeline.html)\n\n> Select applicants will be invited to opt in to our waitlist through their Applicant Portal.\n\n> First-Year applicants must opt in by 11:59 pm PST on April 15.\n\n> Being on the waitlist does not guarantee an offer of admission. We strongly urge students to accept another university's admission offer before the appropriate deadline to ensure they have secured a spot at an institution.\n\n> By June 30, final decisions will be released to applicants who opt in to the waitlist.

If anyone wants to comment on this choice, pls do. My parents are still a bit dicy since they have a huge personal belief that UIUC is the premium cs and tech school after the big 4 (mit Stanford uc berk and cmu). I told them that UIUC's school of information is not that good as UIUC cs and engineering in terms of placement and strength of the degree. Another ug student from UIUC told me that I only need to do calc 2 level study for data sciences. Inner me was disappointed af since I have already done linear algebra and my maths teacher (a gem) is conducting discrete math classes for me since March beginning\n\n2. Do maths cs majors get good internships? I have done Harvard cs 50 courses, both intro and web dev one. I took private classes before for coding in order to be good at competitive programming. I feel more than rigorous coding, I became more interested in the maths part and cracking puzzles through algorithms. Before coming to UCSD, what should I do to get a leg up. (I have already relaxed during my final exams \ud83d\ude2d, now I really wanna return to old me so pls tell the courses to do. I can't rest) \n\n3. I have good graphics skill wrt to ui designing in Adobe softwares. How do I use this to my advantage? I can go ahead with front end dev I guess for getting side jobs or internships during my freshman year. So, my questions basically revolves around the fact that do frosh students get internships via UCSD or not. \n\n4. Dating scene: how tough is it to approach girls? \n\n5.

Though after two quarters I felt like once I explored everything I kinda felt stagnant. Your pros and cons for UCD are very valid lol. The best thing I loved about Davis is how great the DCs were and the fresh food (Cuarto dining bias). From what I remembered it was unlimited swipes and the ARC is great. I think I was in the best physical shape and the most active and healthy. \n\nI'm not entirely sure how important family is for you, but for me, being far away from family is a really big challenge emotionally and mentally. I had a family death occur fall my first year and that weighted on me a lot. Personally decided to drop out during covid and take a gap year back home. I have completely enjoyed and grateful for my experience at UCD for being so far from home, but it also made me appreciate my loved ones a lot more.\n\nMy favorite aspect of UCSD is definitely how resourceful the campus is. Majority of lectures are automatically podcasted and makes attending optional (But also might not be the best learning experience, in person lectures definitely help me learn the best). I think the professors (at least in the psych department) have a really good balance of great teaching and research. Being at a very research driven school your knowledge is very in tune of the most up to date science. Some of my upper div classes don't require textbooks because they are too outdated and my professor's research is being taught. I haven't had a bad professor experience here but I can think of a few professors at UCD that I did not enjoy. \n\nThe location is the prime spot in San Diego. The ocean is less than a mile away and you will have a free trolley pass to go to anywhere in SD. Everywhere on campus is walkable and each college give a cool environmental feel. La Jolla is quite expensive location too - so housing in general will be a constant challenge. \n\nI can't speak on pre-med accommodations but I heard nothing but great things about UCSD Health. \n\nWould I have attended UCSD instead of UCD my first year? No, I think I would still wanted to get out of the SD bubble and made me appreciate a lot of things I took for granted at home.

So the thing with being a k-12 teacher in the US is that in basically every state, you need two qualifications: a bachelor's degree and a teaching credential. Teaching credentials are state-by-state, but with some reciprocity. A bachelor's degree is obviously universal. The thing is that it doesn't really matter what degree you have - generally you'll need a STEM degree to teach STEM in a High School, but otherwise, they don't really care. \n\nSo, the upside of going for EDS is that you get the education theory. However, the education theory you'll get studying EDS is really not that helpful - you're gonna get that getting your credential anyway, as well via CEUs (continuing education units) that you'll need to be getting every year. Because you don't get a credential after a 4-year EDS degree, you still have to go through the post-bacc process, which costs money and time. I think some of your practicum counts towards credential hours (not sure about that, I could be wrong - either way, you can't graduate and go straight to a teaching job).\n\nThe big risk is if you realize teaching isn't for you. Please understand that I don't want to poo-poo your dream - I share it. I really loved working in schools when I did, and quite a few of the teachers I worked with encouraged me to go into the field myself. The thing that scared me off it is that almost universally, every teacher over about 45 I met was burnt out and either felt numb or hated their job. This was at multiple districts, one in a very poor neighborhood (ARUSD) and one in a wealthy neighborhood (SJUSD, and a wealthy area at that). If you have a degree in EDS and decide you want out, your options are basically: more school, sales for a company that sells to schools, or some kind of adult training/teaching role (which tend to be hard to get since a lot of people flee teaching, sadly.) \n\nOn the other hand, if you get a degree in something else that you like and are interested in but that also has some value on the job market, you've got more options if you decide teaching isn't for you. A good middle ground is a double major, which shouldn't be too bad since EDS is not that bad compared to a lot of majors. EDS has a [program](https://eds.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/major.html#Senior-Educational-Fieldwork-Ca) where you can double major and then skip some of the subject matter tests you'd need to take to teach specific subjects. \n\nNo matter what you choose, I wish you good luck! I really don't mean to dump on your dreams, but I really really advise having a backup plan.
