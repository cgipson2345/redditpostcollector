We'll try to respond to as many questions as we can, but it would be great if other current students could also assist in welcoming the new admits!

The mod team will try and get back to you asap, but we are students or alumni and as a result it make take a little bit.\n\nFor more subjective questions, be aware that r/UCSD (and any university subreddit) is not directly representative of the overall student body. In a survey we did of r/UCSD, 2/3 respondents agreed r/UCSD didn't represent UCSD's overall student body. \n\n# A few useful links:\n\n* [The New Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVRH3wrEK3RQ5OZ9cLyPYhzUTtlkNlxq5W9QEIr_CwM/edit?fbclid=IwAR3EwJJxHZsGClKT65_eI_C8a2vsp0yPtdOX9zH6K9he6SQ-vTVBgqJqsik)\n* [UCSD Incoming Student FAQ - The Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBOha62mF0onJOq-f5FuGR4MdNZDLZwhR1GnSrnA1es/edit)\n* Discord Servers\n   * [Class of 2027 Discord](https://discord.gg/HCPwmKhXgB)\n   * [Class of 2025 Discord]( https://discord.gg/6rGpBksv5S)\n   * Additional servers can be found through the [UCSD Discord Servers MegaDoc](https://ucsd.edu/go/discord) after getting your UCSD email. \n* [TritonLink](https://students.ucsd.edu/)\n* [UCSD Support](https://support.ucsd.edu/services)\n* [UCSD Admissions](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/)\n* [r/UCSD Copypasta Archive (need to start the meme indoctrination early)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/wiki/copypasta)\n* [4 Year Plans](http://plans.ucsd.edu)\n\nPlease be aware stuff at UCSD can change *fast*. Most info you can find on this subreddit will still hold true, but there were some major changes in 2020 (Sixth College has a brand new location, Seventh College exists where transfers used to live, transfers moved to a different area).\n\nEighth College is brand new for Fall 2023, with its housing still currently being under construction. As a result, we don't have as much specific info about it besides the GE requirements and the location. \n\n# How do I login to check my admissions decision?\n\nYou should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).\n\n# Can I switch to Computer Science? / I was accepted undeclared but I applied CS!:\n\nIf you were not accepted directly into CSE:CS or CSE:CE (not ECE:CE) and are dead set on being a CS major, you should not attend UCSD. Being admitted undeclared basically means you were accepted to UCSD, but the CSE department rejected your application. Switching into CS is now effectively impossible. The CSE department does not anticipate there being ANY slots for current UCSD students to switch into. More details can be found on the [CSE Capped Major Webpage](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse-capped-admissions-program). *Assume it will be impossible to switch into Computer Science if you were not directly admitted to the major.*\n\n~~Computer Engineering is a bit different, CSE CE and ECE CE are the exact same major requirements (only the advisors are different), but ECE CE is subject to the ECE capped major system (which is not a lottery but requires a high GPA in the screening courses) while CSE CE is subject to the CSE system. So if you are okay with CE instead of CS, you can try going for ECE:CE. It will still be challenging and is far from guaranteed.~~ \n\n[**EDIT: ECE CE WILL NO LONGER BE AN OPTION AND IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE AS WELL.** ](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/capped-major-status)\n\nIf you are set on UCSD but not set on CS, the [Computing Paths page](http://computingpaths.ucsd.edu/) lists other computing related majors that UCSD has such as Math-CS, Cognitive Science, Data Science, etc (but keep in mind these are NOT CS).\n\n# What does the college I got affect? Can I change college? \n\nFor freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.\n\nYour major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (Seventh to the future site of Eighth). \n\nYou cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable. \n\n# I'm waitlisted. What should I do next?\n\n[From UC San Diego Admission Website](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/first-year/application-timeline.html)\n\n> Select applicants will be invited to opt in to our waitlist through their Applicant Portal.\n\n> First-Year applicants must opt in by 11:59 pm PST on April 15.\n\n> Being on the waitlist does not guarantee an offer of admission. We strongly urge students to accept another university's admission offer before the appropriate deadline to ensure they have secured a spot at an institution.\n\n> By June 30, final decisions will be released to applicants who opt in to the waitlist. There is no appeal process for the waitlist.", "title": "Welcome New Tritons!

If anyone wants to comment on this choice, pls do. My parents are still a bit dicy since they have a huge personal belief that UIUC is the premium cs and tech school after the big 4 (mit Stanford uc berk and cmu).

Another ug student from UIUC told me that I only need to do calc 2 level study for data sciences. Inner me was disappointed af since I have already done linear algebra and my maths teacher (a gem) is conducting discrete math classes for me since March beginning\n\n2. Do maths cs majors get good internships? I have done Harvard cs 50 courses, both intro and web dev one. I took private classes before for coding in order to be good at competitive programming. I feel more than rigorous coding, I became more interested in the maths part and cracking puzzles through algorithms. Before coming to UCSD, what should I do to get a leg up.

I have good graphics skill wrt to ui designing in Adobe softwares. How do I use this to my advantage? I can go ahead with front end dev I guess for getting side jobs or internships during my freshman year. So, my questions basically revolves around the fact that do frosh students get internships via UCSD or not. \n\n4. Dating scene: how tough is it to approach girls? \n\n5.

Remember that we're all students who graduate in about 4 years, give or take a year. This means orgs are really prone to turnover, and are thus very susceptible to change YoY.\n\nAnother way to change things is to make yourself heard. Go to ASCE meetings. Go to AS senate meetings.

What you\u2019ve got to realize is that you have intrinsic worth not because your parents gave you life and assigned you some kind of concrete value through \u201cinvestment,\u201d but simply because you are human. You have worth because you are alive. \n\nLike, it doesn\u2019t matter at all (to your worth as a person) whether or not you\u2019re successful. Your worth is not defined by your financial/academic output. Yeah, that\u2019s important and all for financial security and being able to live in this dogshit system of ours, but that\u2019s another issue entirely. My point is that regardless of your output, or your parents\u2019 \u201creturn on investment,\u201d you are still worthwhile. If your parents can\u2019t understand that, if they see you only as their project or their potential caregiver, they\u2019ve failed you as parents. They should value you simply by virtue of being their child, nothing more, nothing less. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s on them, not on you to do better.\n\nThat might be a hard conclusion to come to, especially if you\u2019ve had this purely concrete perception of worth all your life.

I came from a high school in the Idaho school system so I was already miles behind everybody else when I started freshman year. I went through a really bad breakup at the beginning of year 2, and I nearly dropped out and moved home. My dad died at the beginning of year 3's winter quarter which also prompted the end of a 2nd relationship,  so I missed half of that quarter. And at the beginning of that spring quarter, I had some girl smack the shit out of me several times, so I was forced to quit attending discussion sections for an incredibly difficult class just to get away from her. I have never outright failed a class, but that was only prevented due to some intense grading curves in more courses than I care to acknowledge. I knew I was going to struggle, so I spent way too much time on CAPES looking for the most lenient professors.\n\nI never once seemed able to catch a break in my personal life, was seemingly never able to properly study because I was either too depressed to feed myself, or too busy trying to put the pieces of my life back together. I did the bare minimum to get my work completed and submitted to my professors. I hated college. I still do; I know I'm not wired for this kind of book-based learning.  \n\nBut my lab partners saved my ass last fall. They convinced me to break my cycle of going straight home and sitting by myself after classes. They forced me to go get food with them, and even attend a couple of events on campus. They even got me to enter Geisel for the first time and actually look over my notes. In order to actually complete my academic career at UCSD I had to find a person who was able to help me focus; someone who took my career choice as seriously as they took theirs. And I won't lie, it happened by complete accident for me. I probably would have dropped my last two lab classes that quarter because I was struggling to pass, and was seriously rethinking giving up and becoming a mechanic like I intended to do in high school. But my lab partners stuck with me, and because of that I not only graduated, but I graduated early. I'm now taking anatomy at a community college, (one of the most difficult classes that I have ever enrolled in), and am passing with flying colors. I learned that my success depends on the classmates I hang out with and how much we study together.\n\nTL;DR you have got to find at least 1 person who will hold you accountable, because the company you keep can dictate your own success or failure.

I did not get care and just struggled through my classes. I later figured out it was anxiety and depression cause I tried to kill myself in the spring of my freshman year. I was at this super rural college so I got taken to a horrible psych ward and got sexually assaulted by another patient. Then I developed PTSD from that experience.  During that year and a half, my GPA was 2.3 and I withdrew from 5 classes.\n\nI later got long covid, which turned into postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and i was wheelchair bound for a while. That was it for me lol. I withdrew from that first college and moved back home (which was really much better for the PTSD).\n\nThen I did a couple of intensive outpatient programs, therapy, and cardiac rehab and tried out a lot of meds. During this time I took classes at the school closest to the hospitals I was at (which was Mesa Community College). The classes were all online and I managed to get straight As because the content was easier, it was online, and I could take a lighter load.\n\nThen I decided I wanted to finish my degree so I came to UCSD so I could keep all my doctors and stay at home, and I have only gotten A and A+'s here. I am so much healthier and school is so much easier when I am healthy. That is really want I want to impart to you-- it is really hard to be academically successful if you are fighting mental or physical illness while you're in classes. Taking a break is ok. So is pausing for a bit. \n\nRecovering from mental health issues (or at least managing them) is way harder than school- it is a full time job and it is exhausting. For instance, \n\nyou could do a cognitive behavioral outpatient program (this is 8 hours a day, 5 days a week and you also have about 4 hours of 'homework' a night)\n\nYou could go to UCSD's CAPs, I liked the support groups by Tiffany O'Meara. This is a few hours a week\n\nYou could go to the depression bipolar support alliance of san diego (free) which can be up to 8 hours a week\n\nNot to mention the fatigue and side effects from meds. \n\nPlus meetings with your therapist and psychiatrist. \n\nHaving mental health problems makes school so super hard. You'd be amazed by what you can accomplish when you're not dealing with all that. But to recover from it, you really need to work. It took me so much time and energy that stepping back academically to a CC was the best choice I could make. I'm not saying you should do that, but you could really take this summer to find support systems that work for you. I wish friends were the answer but I have a ton of anxiety and simply could not make them. There are ways to get socialization beyond making friends- support groups are super helpful. And they can guide you on how to help yourself.  \n\nTBH it was all about being gentle with myself. I really recommend cognitive behavioral therapy, taking a break, and regrouping. I know I've been super fortunate to have the resources to go to all those doctors and have a second shot at my undergraduate education.\n\nAlso, if you can turn it around- it makes a great story for grad schools apps. I'm headed to law school next year with a full ride. I really hope things get better for you soon\n\noh and the free online DBSA meetings can be found at this link [https://www.meetup.com/dbsa-san-diego/](https://www.meetup.com/dbsa-san-diego/) there are some great people and it is a really good first step to take if you want. \n\nfor me, health= academic success. \n\nThe best part...

That's the type of stuff that's probably more so on the compiled list or things you can find online. \n\nIf you're looking for what you'll end up doing, depends on the type of person you are but UTC, Convoy street, beaches, hillcrest, gaslamp, plenty of places to check out for food and activities but it's harder to give suggestions without knowing who you are.\n\nIf you're looking for more UCSD specific things, I don't know exactly what's on the guided tour, but assuming it covers most of the stuff on campus I'd suggest taking a look at things that aren't main attractions at the center of campus.

    {"subreddit": "UCSD", "body": "I\u2019ve been in this lab for a few years \u201cVolunteering\u201d for them over the summer as free labor, unable to see my parents cause they are overseas. Having the PI dangle a recommendation letter over my head as if I\u2019m a dog going after a piece of steak and telling me I\u2019m gaining lots of experience in the lab by doing the same shit I\u2019ve been doing since I got here? The same recommendation letter they\u2019re having us write ourselves and having them just sign it? Having the PI ask me several times when I\u2019m going to quit my other job that actually gives me some income so I can put more of my time into their lab and not get paid a singular cent? I\u2019m sick and tired of this shit but it\u2019s too late to switch to another lab cause I\u2019m still doing a program with them for another year before I officially leave. The PI is never physically in lab and leaves all administration and undergraduate management to our lab tech. Which in itself is a whole other problem. \n\nOur lab tech has no leadership skills whatsoever and does not know how to manage undergrads. First off, undergrads in our lab have weekly default hours and have to strictly follow a schedule that adds up to a certain number of hours but that doesn\u2019t even include our lab meetings plus all the other shit we have to do outside of lab like data analysis and also the lab tech texting us to do shit at ungodly hours. I feel that it\u2019s just inappropriate asking unpaid undergraduate students to do shit for the paid lab tech. The lab tech has made it very clear and also laughs it off as \u201cI need to use these undergrads as free labor to keep the lab afloat\u201d. It\u2019s ridiculous. If you need someone to do lab chores, please hire a lab assistant. \n\nIt\u2019s been bearable until maybe sometime last year, when the new policy for undergrads was that if you miss a certain day, you have to make up hours you missed that day. Sure, I get it if we were paid. But we\u2019re not. Plus usually when we come in, we don\u2019t have shit to do anyways. It\u2019s always just lab chores that have already been done yesterday or shit the lab tech makes up to keep us \u201cbusy\u201d. So I don\u2019t understand needing to come in to \u201cmake up hours\u201d when there\u2019s genuinely nothing to do? I don\u2019t fucking get it. All the lab tech is doing is fostering this environment for us to not help each other. They are so by-the-book annoying it\u2019s literally so intolerable. They aren\u2019t lenient with us undergrads so why should we say we\u2019re available when there\u2019s an emergency? We\u2019re not even gonna get time off in exchange for that. The lab tech has made it so they\u2019re carrying a whole lot more than they can take because of this system they\u2019re enforcing. If they were more lenient with our hours and stop making us do unnecessary shit, we\u2019d actually be willing to help them out when they need it. \n\nOn top of that, the undergrads that don\u2019t have projects are required to help the other people who do have projects and sometimes that\u2019s all they do when they come in that day. It\u2019s shitty and it\u2019s boring. It feels like we\u2019re being used as free labor and we\u2019re not even appreciated. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of details I didn\u2019t include because I want to remain anonymous but anyways that\u2019s it.

    {"subreddit": "UCSD", "body": "Over the weeks, Wolftown has been knocking it out of the field with these cultural street food for college food standards. Their peak honestly had to be two weeks ago when they did Greek street food. It was not authentic, that's for sure, but goddamn was it good compared to the dining hall food I'd eat on the weekly basis.\n\nWhen it came to this week, I was so excited that they were doing Filipino \"street\" food. I adore Filipino cuisine, and know what dishes should taste like relatively. This time around, they did the whole country of Philippines SOOO dirty with whatever substance they were serving.\n\nWhen first opening the menu, I had the biggest grin to my face. It felt like Christmas day seeing all these delicious sounding meals to choose from for lunch. This was breaking news, so I had to tell my Filipino friend how his culture was being represented at UCSD \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f. He too was estatic and recommended me to try the chicken adobo since it SHOULD be the reliable meal to fallback on when you don't know what to choose. However my fat ass was intrigued by the porkbelly, so I disregarded my friend's recommendation and chose to go with the pork belly bowl. \n\nWhen my order was ready for pickup, I felt the blood rushing through my body. I was speed walking to Wolftown, calves were pumped and my face was poised with determination to get my pork belly bowl. But when my eyes first laid upon the war crime of the so-called \"Filipino street food\", my heart sank.\n\nThe cream situation. These people DRENCHED the bowl in the white oozey cream sauce as if the worker passed out 6 times trying to assemble my food. But you know what, I'm a saucy person so I'll let it slide.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, my ear to ear grin began to droop down to a blank stare. The saurkraut. UCSD must be a bottom because they just love having SAURKRAUT top anything and everything at this school. TIME AND PLACE!!! Like I best NOT be seeing that shit on my SOUTHEAST ASIAN dishes like GODDAMN. But you know what? I'm a pickle person so okay fine, I'll LET that slide as well.\n\nI sat down to start chomping down on this questionable meal. When my fork TOUCHED the surface of this dish, it sank. There was no structure to this dish, it just gave in. It was soupy. The juices from the saurkraut, charro beans, pico de gallo, bok choy, AND pork belly grease all came together to turn this \"rice bowl\" into a BOWL OF SOUP!!!! I have just had it with this establishment, but I paid my money and I wasn't going to let this meal go to waste so I let THAT SLIDE and began to chow down.\n\nI picked up a pile of dripping rice, and placed it onto my tongue. My body went into shock, ripples or spikes sent through my mouth and brain and back. My butthole clentched, face recoiled, and toes gripping my sandels as if these doggies' lives depended on it. WHY IS IT SO GODDAMN SOUR AND SALTY???!!! Like has the executive chef who curated these dishes not ONCE put this abomination onto their taste buds? How could you mess up this badly??? Like I know it's a gag how dining hall food is inedible but this shit ACTUALLY IS INEDIBLE. You cannot go more than one bite without your body grasping for a sip of ANYTHING. More than 3 bites and you will probably go into a coma from the excess amount of salt you just consumed. \n\nNot to mention I was eating this in a now CLOSED AIR room (my dorm) and the acidic gasses that were emitted from this dish were so overwhelming, it made me get a zero on a remote quiz that I was taking in the same room because I was getting headaches from the stench. Not even my farts could overpower the smell coming from the bowl.\n\nI am now in tears, my stomach sending out cries for help. The Phillipines did not deserve this cultural disrespect.

In term of academics, I think UCSD beats out UCLA by a decent margin. While the name of UCLA is nice, UCSD is the Mecca for biology. We are surrounded by some of the biggest biotech companies in the world, are a walk away from the Salk Institute, and have amazing researchers on campus doing amazing things. There are a wealth of options for internships and jobs here and UCLA can\u2019t compete. On top of that, I feel that nearly every biology teacher I have had have been pretty fantastic and I have learned a lot from them. \n\nNow in terms of social life and community, UCLA trumps UCSD by a long shot. Being on UCLA campus, it feels so social and active, people are constantly participating in activities and there events are on point. No matter what type of person you are, it seems that you will find friends at UCLA. Now In terms of UCSD, I feel like I have had a lot more luck than other people when it comes to a social life, and even then I still feel lonely. UC Socially Dead is an accurate description and it\u2019s sad. People here seem to value their futures more than their present, and that results in less interaction. On top of that, a lot of the events here have felt lack luster or uneventful, partially for the fault of the students, though they do seem to be improving. \n\nIn terms of location, it depends on what you want and what you have access to. Westwood is a great neighborhood that feels very college town and makes accessing school really easy. A draw back is it seems like you have to have a double or triple at UCLA. The city of LA is exciting if you have a car but pointless if you don\u2019t. UCSD is in a pretty, but boring location and it\u2019s a pain to get around the La Jolla. That being said, public transit and the trolly is much better than that of LAs and there\u2019s some really cool places to explore in SD. \n\nPersonally, I wish I had gone to UCLA. While I\u2019m happy for my academic experiences, they were never able to outweigh the negative social experience I have had here.

    {"subreddit": "UCSD", "body": "Hey! I'm in a bit of a weird situation and I'd like some opinions so as to avoid making any clear mistakes. I know this is more fit for a general subreddit, but this works fine too as I feel much better talking to fellow UCSD people, idk why.\n\nAnyways . as a fellow college student, like many, me and my friends from high school all went our separate ways. The only relationship I've tried to maintain is that with my girlfriend, as up until now we've been together for 4 years. she studies out of state so she's a bit far.\n\nLets just say that fall quarter, for a variety of reasons, with faults on both sides, my relationship with my girlfriend went very much downhill. It got to a point where all of our conversations were just heated arguments and petty insults. Eventually we agreed that we needed space and to \"take a break\". It was pretty ugly \n\nSuffice to say I haven't talked to her in 5 whole months, and hell my mutual friends with her even told me she's seeing someone else right now, but I won't believe it until I confirm it with her. \n\nmeanwhile, over on my end, throughout the whole year, I've become very very close friends with one of my colleagues. We are colleagues in orchestra, we are members of the same organizations, and we study frequently together, almost everyday. We also hangout as part of the same circle of friends, so I see her regularly. She's probably one of my most trusted friends I've made this quarter and we're exceptionally close. \n\nAs of right now we're just friends, but over the course of the year (slowly I'll emphasize), I realize that I'm very much falling for her, I've developed very strong feelings for her and she's very important to me. I'm sure of it as she's always in the back of my mind and my favorite part of any day is just getting work done with her. I've tried so hard to ignore the feelings at first, but they get stronger by the day, and as of now, those feelings couldn't be any stronger. \n\nThe issue is, she's from New York and I'm from here, she has an internship for all of fall quarter next year, and on top of that she's graduating early next year, while I have a bit to go. What that means is that in practice if I did ask her out and it worked, we'd only be together a few weeks, have a huge gap in time where we couldn't see each other, and even when she came back, she'd finish school before I did, and of course she needs to get her career started which I respect. \n\nNot to mention I still don't know what the hell is with my current relationship as we haven't spoken in months, and obviously I need to get that squared away before doing anything. Not doing so would obviously be plain wrong. \n\nThe situation as a whole is just very conflicting, and it really bothers me, I'd like some input, or any input really, especially if you've been in something similar.", "title": "Grey Situation (Need Advice)", "id": "12xs90j", "score": 4, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/12xs90j/grey_situation_need_advice/", "permalink": "/r/UCSD/comments/12xs90j/grey_situation_need_advice/", "author": "Valen_Wang1107", "comments": [{"id": "jhjzbs7", "body": "A.

(not really UCSD or their fault, but still gonna include it) accidentally set an early morning alarm few days back, and after scrolling through my notifications to try to stop the alarm, i saw a buried notification of someone in my past insta dm'd me and i was like whatever but me being half asleep tried to jokingly impulse-book a trip to the east coast to take that city off a pedestal, but couldnt log into the southwest app, and the website login didnt work too (the flight listings were acting wacky too), and when i tried to reset password it said account not found, so i kinda got scared shitless since i thought my account got banned or smth (not that i did anything wrong) so (since my roomie wasnt there) i call the help line, and they said their system was down, so i went back to sleep. next morning i missed the sale and also decided rationally not to book, but yea it was all in the news since they were grounded and fast forward, that night at a meeting we actually had to stay longer since a key club decision maker was in oakland their flight back was majorly delayed, causing us to stay til like 10 pm (for reference the meeting started at 6:00)\n2. over the past week or so the ucsd housing server has been acting up rly badly, while working on applications and preparing to do room contract stuff, since like prob a lot of people were trying to use it but they don't even try to fix it/just said whatever bs, and it kept going down many different times and ppl were just pissed. it happened throughout both last week and this week and there were tasks to complete, so it was rly disruptive. it was especially bad this week since it literally went down right when my lottery-assigned room selection time started today, and it just wouldnt load again, and like i wasn't even the first room selection time (not even one of the first) and it wasnt the first time it happened. as a result i just had to keep refreshing and trying, and ended up getting to room selection late, well after it went back up, and i had a lot fewer choices for the rooms that i was allowed to choose from, and even though it may be because of a late lottery time, this still prob like screwed me over in housing room selection. to make matters worse they prob didnt even try to fix it they just like kicked everyone out and delayed the process, like every time they just open something later or try to get people to stop logging in, and this week how they continued to try to fix it was saying now we cant make meal plan changes or even go to other options that are supposed to be available around now in order to \"ensure a smooth experience\" which is literally bs and it sucks either way\n3. right around midnight i had a essay-quiz that i needed to submit, and i was literally almost done, but right around then the library wifi (or at least one of the routers) went \"down\". it would take so much just to move somewhere else (if anywhere worked) or to use my hotspot, and it wouldnt get in on time either way since it was like 11:57 when it happened. i was still finishing up my last sentence and about to quickly submit then the wifi screwed up. i emailed the teacher to try to get an exception but the autoreply was literally the policy posted on the canvas which is literally a no one cares type of thing, \"If you are 1 minute late... you will lose \\[20% of your grade\\].\" like this is the 3rd issue with technology this week and the 2nd in a day and both that day were ucsd fault. literally submitted at 12:05 because of this and i had to turn on my hotspot, and i hope the teacher responds to the email, but idk if the guy cares. he seems to be raised in a country with super strict cultures and deadlines (so not his fault, but still), and in our experiences they literally don't care about anything and won't accommodate anyone or for anything, like literally not human, the in-human robot without brain or emotions no excuses type, zero tolerance, that bs, and the ta seems to be worse and more toxic and not care at all. like most non-US raised people esp the fobs raised in a super toxic culture (at least most of them, not all (some do adapt, and on the other hand there are too many toxic ppl here in the US as well), but still) are literally the most likely to be like that, some of them i heard don't even care if there's a fire alarm or if the buildings literally on fire. then a fob (fresh off the boat) ta finally responded days later and said yea ur prob gonna hafta take a penalty. finally when the teacher did respond they just said heres the policy its on u. like rly?!? its IT's fault and now ur just gonna push it onto us. u gotta love their attitude. like can we just treat humans as humans? it might be time for some training in the matter.  \nwhile we CAN'T do anything about Southwest or even the teacher's grading regarding the library wifi even though its literally not our fault, we CAN however, have a strike and demand reforming, defunding, and potentially taking over UCSD HDH and IT (and maybe even the library) (or even abolishing the current system in control of them). maybe even make it student-run or at least with oversight.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, if they paid the workers a living and fair wage, it wouldn't be like this and things would work much better and everyone happier (hint hint wink wink)\n\nchancellor is literally paid millions and we're building so many new college (and not focusing on the academic part of them btw) while everyone else (workers and students) suffers and also has to put up with shitty resources", "title": "Rant: How does our school have money for new college but not for IT?

If you can get out of more gen ed requirements, what would you do instead? Does that allow for the possibility to graduate early? Are there more opportunities to take courses that interest you? Leave room for double majors and minors? And will those courses you take just be out of your own desire since the credit won't be needed I'm assuming?\u00a0\n\nYou graduate when you complete your GE and major requirements. If you have AP credit for GE and major requirements, you can graduate sooner. Or take other classes if you want. Or try and fit in a minor or double major. \n\nYou plan your own schedule. You enroll in your own classes. You can do what you want but you're responsible for saying on track. \n\n> Thirdly, how does the unit system work? Are courses generally weighted as 4 units? Does the 180 unit requirement encompass the units from AP scores?\n\nMost courses are 4 units. Technically it's supposed to be a representation of how many hours you'll work. 1 unit is supposed to be one hour of instruction per week, two hours of work outside of class per week. But this can vary. \n\nThe 180 unit requirement encompasses all units yes. So AP units will be counted. \n\n> Also, what is the elective credit awarded for certain AP scores? Is that just the additional credits outside of your major and gen ed required to graduate?\n\nElective credit from an AP is just credit that doesn't apply to any specific requirement. So if your major and GEs add up to less than 180 units, your AP elective credit can get you up to 180 and help you graduate sooner. \n\nYou also get earlier enrollment times the more units you have. So having more AP credit can help you enroll in classes earlier. \n\n> It seems as though I will have fulfilled credit for 9/11 lower division GEs. Where will this put me in terms of how much of a head start this will give me? How will this benefit me?\n\nIf this is correct, this can save a lot of time. I do think it's incorrect though.
