Comparatively, social eating behavior is related to the enjoyment of eating meals with chosen company, which could be friends or family.\n\nA recent Clinical Nutrition study investigated the impact of family meals and social eating behavior on anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms in adolescents.\n\nGlobally, a rapid increase in mental disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, has been recorded. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 970 million people worldwide were affected with mental disorders in 2019. Interestingly, around 50% of mental disorders manifest by the age of fourteen. \n\nAdolescence is the period when an individual undergoes many cognitive, physical, and socio-affective changes, many of which make them more vulnerable to developing mental health problems. The onset of mental health symptoms, or even subclinical manifestations, in adolescents predicts psychopathological development in the future, which increases the risk of mortality, morbidity, and disability. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective interventions for mental health problems in children and adolescents in both schools and outside school settings\nThe development of mental health problems is associated with environmental and genetic factors. Several social determinants, such as economic and environmental events, may prevent or increase the risk of mental issues.\n\nhttps://www.news-medical.net/news/20230503/Sharing-meals-with-friends-may-lower-depression-anxiety-and-stress-in-teens.aspx", "score": 4, "author": "Wagamaga", "page_title": "\r\n\tSharing meals with friends may lower depression, anxiety, and stress in teens\r\n"}]}

In line with psychotherapeutic research, qualitative research has highlighted the role of reductions in experiential avoidance (and increases in connectedness) within psilocybin therapy. However, no quantitative research has examined experiential avoidance as a mechanism underlying psilocybin therapy's therapeutic effects.\r  \n\r  \nMethod\r  \nData was used from a double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared psilocybin therapy (two 25\u202fmg psilocybin session plus daily placebo for six weeks) with escitalopram (two 1\u202fmg psilocybin sessions plus 10\u201320\u202fmg daily escitalopram for six weeks) among individuals with major depressive disorder (N\u202f=\u202f59). All participants received psychological support. Experiential avoidance, connectedness, and treatment outcomes were measured at pre-treatment and at a 6\u202fweek primary endpoint. Acute psilocybin experiences and psychological insight were also measured.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nWith psilocybin therapy, but not escitalopram, improvements in mental health outcomes (i.e., well-being, depression severity, suicidal ideation, and trait anxiety) occurred via reductions in experiential avoidance. Exploratory analyses suggested that improvements in mental health (except for suicidal ideation) via reduction in experiential avoidance were serially mediated through increases in connectedness. Additionally, experiences of ego dissolution and psychological insight predicted reductions in experiential avoidance following psilocybin therapy.\r  \n\r  \nLimitations\r  \nDifficulties inferring temporal causality, maintaining blindness to condition, and reliance upon self-report.\r  \n\r  \nConclusions\r  \nThese results provide support for the role of reduced experiential avoidance as a putative mechanism underlying psilocybin therapy's positive therapeutic outcomes.

Crucially, it was unknown (a) how older adults compare to age groups below young adulthood and (b) whether children can recognize emotions at shorter durations, with short durations likely common in real life. We compared emotion recognition in 5-year-olds, 8-year-olds, young adults and older adults at very brief durations (50\u2009ms, 250\u2009ms) as well as standard unlimited durations. Eight-year-olds were better than 5-year-olds, young adults than all groups, and there was a striking similarity between 8-year-olds and older adults, providing the first clear indication that older adults' recognition abilities are equivalent to that of an 8-year-old at all durations. Emotion recognition was above chance on all emotions and durations among the three older age groups and on most stimuli for 5-year-olds.\n\n*And from the discussion section:*\n\n\"We had the following two aims: (1) to examine older adults relative to three groups of younger individuals to gain perspective on the relative decrement in older adults' emotion recognition and (2) to determine whether children and older adults were above chance when identifying emotions presented at very short durations. To this end, we presented photographs of facial expressions at three durations (50\u2009ms, 250\u2009ms and unlimited) to four age groups (5\u2009years, 8\u2009years, young adults and older adults).\"\"There were two main findings.\"\n\n\"First, when considering overall emotion recognition (the main effect for emotion recognition shown in Figure 1), there were significant differences between all pairs of age groups, with the exception of 8-year-olds and older adults. Performance improved between 5 and 8\u2009years, and then again to young adulthood, whereas older adults had worse emotion recognition than young adults, were better than 5-year-olds and were equal to 8-year-olds. Thus, older adults' overall emotion recognition (mean unbiased hit rate = 0.50) is most like that of an 8-year-olds (mean unbiased hit rate = 0.48), with the findings at each of the three durations also similar. Obviously, emotion recognition in older-old (e.g. 75+) would be expected to be worse than recognition in young-old (e.g. 60\u201374) so that splitting this group further would result in a potential non-equivalence with 8-year-olds. Nevertheless, as a group, older adults are on a par with 8-year-olds.\"\n\n\"The second set of findings concerned the effect of duration. Five-year-olds' emotion recognition was most affected by short durations, 8-year-olds and older adults less so and young adults least of all. Nevertheless, the difference between the age groups was not large with 5-year-olds' recognition of four emotions compromised by short durations, two each for 8-year-olds and older adults and one for young adults. Since there were 18 comparisons in total, for the most part, 5-year-olds' recognition was not compromised to a greater extent than the older age groups by short durations. Replicating previous findings that fear and disgust are difficult for young children to recognize (Gagnon et al., 2010; Theurel et al., 2016; Tonks et al., 2007; Widen & Russell, 2008b, 2010), 5-year-olds were at chance on fear at all durations and disgust at 50\u2009ms and 250\u2009ms.\"", "score": 8, "author": "A-manual-cant"}]}

If this association is causal, the increasing obesity prevalence might lead to worsening population mental health, but the strength of the causal effect has not been systematically evaluated.\r  \n\r  \nSubjects/methods\r  \nThe current study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining associations between body mass index and depression using Mendelian randomization with multiple genetic variants as instruments for body mass index. We used this estimate to calculate the expected changes in prevalence of population psychological distress from the 1990s\u20132010s, which were compared with the empirically observed trends in psychological distress in the Health Survey for England (HSE) and U.S. National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS).\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nMeta-analysis of 8 Mendelian randomization studies indicated an OR\u202f=\u202f1.33 higher depression risk associated with obesity (95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.48). Between 15% and 20% of the participants of HSE and NHIS reported at least moderate psychological distress. The increase of obesity prevalence from the 1990s\u20132010s in HSE and NHIS would have led to a 0.6 percentage-point increase in population psychological distress.\r  \n\r  \nConclusions\r  \nMendelian randomization studies suggest that obesity is a causal risk factor for elevated risk of depression. The increasing obesity rates may have modestly increased the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the general population. Mendelian randomization relies on methodological assumptions that may not always hold, so other quasi-experimental methods are needed to confirm the current conclusions.", "score": 2, "author": "314-pi"}]}

We addressed this issue by analyzing the electroencephalograms (EEG) of four dying patients before and after the clinical withdrawal of their ventilatory support and found that the resultant global hypoxia markedly stimulated gamma activities in two of the patients. The surge of gamma connectivity was both local, within the temporo\u2013parieto\u2013occipital (TPO) junctions, and global between the TPO zones and the contralateral prefrontal areas. While the mechanisms and physiological significance of these findings remain to be fully explored, these data demonstrate that the dying brain can still be active. They also suggest the need to reevaluate role of the brain during cardiac arrest.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe brain is assumed to be hypoactive during cardiac arrest. However, animal models of cardiac and respiratory arrest demonstrate a surge of gamma oscillations and functional connectivity. \n\nTo investigate whether these preclinical findings translate to humans, we analyzed electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram signals in four comatose dying patients before and after the withdrawal of ventilatory support. Two of the four patients exhibited a rapid and marked surge of gamma power, surge of cross-frequency coupling of gamma waves with slower oscillations, and increased interhemispheric functional and directed connectivity in gamma bands. \n\nHigh-frequency oscillations paralleled the activation of beta/gamma cross-frequency coupling within the somatosensory cortices. Importantly, both patients displayed surges of functional and directed connectivity at multiple frequency bands within the posterior cortical \u201chot zone,\u201d a region postulated to be critical for conscious processing. This gamma activity was stimulated by global hypoxia and surged further as cardiac conditions deteriorated in the dying patients. \n\nThese data demonstrate that the surge of gamma power and connectivity observed in animal models of cardiac arrest can be observed in select patients during the process of dying.", "score": 2126, "author": "Homme-au-doigt", "page_title": "Just a moment..."}, {"id": "jiicv16", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 1000, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jiip33n", "body": "Interesting.

We investigate the overall power contribution of mobile communication towers to the Earth\u2019s radio leakage budget, as seen from a selection of different nearby stellar systems. \n\nWe created a model of this leakage using publicly available data of mobile tower locations. The model grids the surface of the planet into small, computationally manageable regions, assuming a simple integrated transmission pattern for the mobile antennas. In this model, these mobile tower regions rise and set as the Earth rotates. In this way, a dynamic power spectrum of the Earth was determined, summed over all cellular frequency bands. We calculated this dynamic power spectrum from three different viewing points \u2013 HD 95735, Barnard\u2019s star, and Alpha Centauri A.\n\nOur preliminary results demonstrate that the peak power leaking into space from mobile towers is \u223c4GW. This is associated with Long Term Evolution (LTE) mobile tower technology emanating from the East Coast of China as viewed from HD 95735. We demonstrate that the mobile tower leakage is periodic, direction dependent, and could not currently be detected by a nearby civilization located within 10 light-years of the Earth, using instrumentation with a sensitivity similar to the Green Bank Telescope. \n\nWe plan to extend our model to include more powerful 5G mobile systems, radar installations, ground based up-links (including the Deep Space Network), and various types of satellite services, including low-Earth orbit constellations, such as Starlink and OneWeb.", "score": 3, "author": "Hannibalonprozac"}, {"id": "jim701p", "body": "And this is a demonstration of why we don't know if there's entire galactic civilizations out there.\n\nThere's just no way we'd detect a modern civilization, even a lot of civilizations, unless they were like, on alpha proxima (nearest star) or were blasting out radio signals like from some dedicated mega fusion plant like a galactic disco ball yelling \"hey look at me!\"", "score": 8, "author": "FranticPonE"}, {"id": "jim9f1c", "body": "\"and could not currently be detected by a nearby civilization located within 10 light-years of the Earth\"\n\nSeems like a back to front way of putting it - the signal is only going to get weaker, and harder to detect, if more than 10 light years away!\n\nOr does the 10 light years come from the fact that we only properly started LTE transmissions around 10 years ago?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wonder where the estimate of 4GW total radiated (leaked into space) power comes from: it seems like probably assuming around 30 million base stations of around 200 watts each... but you would expect operators to tilt their antenna down towards the horizon, as power lost to space is wasted to them.", "score": 4, "author": "Prestigious_Carpet29"}, {"id": "jiph2iu", "body": "Now do it for the high power weather radars that blanket much of our planet.   \n\nA WSR-88D NEXRAD at 3 GHz and 750,000 watts to an 8+ meter dish and very narrow bandwidth is going to be detectable quite a bit farther.", "score": 2, "author": "dittybopper_05H"}, {"id": "jim17zd", "body": "Maybe they can save us from the AI uprising", "score": 4, "author": "RudegarWithFunnyHat"}, {"id": "jip2cxz", "body": " I could have told you that without a study.

MUFAs upregulate the number of lipid droplets in fat storage tissues. Increased lipid droplet number is necessary for MUFA-induced longevity and predicts remaining lifespan. Lipidomics datasets reveal that MUFAs also modify the ratio of membrane lipids and ether lipids\u2014a signature associated with decreased lipid oxidation. In agreement with this, MUFAs decrease lipid oxidation in middle-aged individuals. Intriguingly, MUFAs upregulate not only lipid droplet number but also peroxisome number. A targeted screen identifies genes involved in the co-regulation of lipid droplets and peroxisomes, and reveals that induction of both organelles is optimal for longevity.

Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until \\~10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages. These findings advance ongoing debates regarding why, when, and how early-life adversity shapes later neural outcomes.", "score": 3, "author": "314-pi"}]}

The study was published in the [Archives of Sexual Behavior](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-023-02573-y).\n\nExtradyadic romantic experiences, commonly known as infidelity, refer to a person being emotionally or sexually intimate with someone outside their committed romantic relationship. Extradyadic romantic experiences can occur in different forms ranging from one-night stands to long-lasting affairs.\n\nExtradyadic romantic experiences are also a source of great controversy and paradoxical views and behaviors. Polls on large samples show that nearly all people see infidelity as a moral transgression. They typically report great distress at the mere thought of their own partner committing infidelity.\n\nInfidelity is a leading predictor of divorce and intimate partner violence. In spite of all this, substantial numbers of people choose to cheat on their romantic partners. Estimates say that around one in five married people cheat their partners. The share rises to one in three among young adults in dating relationships.\n\nMost studies have tried to explain this contrast by proposing that infidelity happens because the relationship a person is in is lacking. On the other hand, studies have shown that many people engaging in infidelity despite rating their marriages as happy or very happy.

Here, we show that adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)\u2013mediated expression of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) can increase outflow in two murine models of glaucoma and in nonhuman primates. We show that long-term AAV9 transduction of the corneal endothelium in the nonhuman primate is safe and well tolerated. Last, MMP-3 increases outflow in donor human eyes.

Also if it never transmitted from your pocket it wouldn't be able to do cell-handovers... so if you were travelling you might not be able to receive calls (or any \"notifications\") unless you very frequently took your phone out of your pocket...\n\nIn any case, fewer people seem to use a phone for talking these days, fewer people hold it close to the head, people use wireless (low power short range headsets...), WiFi calling is increasingly prevalent...   And I suspect the trend for phones to have a screen covering practically the entire front surface of the phone in any case means the RF signal coming out of the \"front\" is weaker on new models than older ones. Plus increasing use of WiFi calling means that in typically home/work environments the phone will be using vastly less RF power than if it were connecting solely to the cellular network...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I am a physicist and electronics engineer; have an interest in RF comms technology but I do not work in that field.

Long-term exposure \"observational\" studies are inherently difficult to tie cause and effect. You also seem to get a disproportionate number of review papers cross-referencing themselves, Some lab experiments on lab rats/mice have used very high RF levels, sufficient to cause heating, and if pulsed to probably cause thermo-acoustic sound sensation - which may be the cause of stress in the lab-rats, and may not be extrapolated to more-reasonable exposure levels.\n\nThe field is also increasingly politicised, seeking to \"prove\" than something is dangerous, rather than open-mindedly and \"curiously\" exploring mechanisms. To pick one reference at random, ref. 58 of this study,  (on a reported rise in brain cancers)  in its Abstract says \"the percentage rise is similar across the age groups, which suggests widespread environmental or lifestyle factors may be responsible. This article reports incidence data trends and **does not provide additional evidence for the role of any particular risk factor**.\" \\[my bold\\]\n\nRef. 60 \"Interphone study\" conclusion \"**Overall, no increase in risk of glioma or meningioma was observed with use of mobile phones.** There were suggestions of an increased risk of glioma at the highest exposure levels, but biases and error prevent a causal interpretation.\"\n\nRef.71 Conclusions \"**Thyroid cancer incidence has been steeply increasing in Sweden and all Nordic countries during the 21st century.

Combining ultrasound imaging, theoretical analysis, and simulations, we developed and validated a mechanistic model that explains how the kinematics of individual active filaments determines their emergent collective topological dynamics.

We obtained hourly information on the onset of symptomatic arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial and ventricular premature beats and supraventricular tachycardia) from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database \u2014 Chest Pain Center (including 2025 certified hospitals in 322 cities). We obtained data on hourly concentrations of 6 air pollutants from the nearest monitors, including fine particles (PM2.5), coarse particles (PM2.5\u201310), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone. For each patient, we matched the case period to 3 or 4 control periods during the same hour, day of week, month and year. We used conditional logistic regression models to analyze the data.\n>\n>...\n>\n>Interpretation: Exposure to air pollution was associated with the onset of symptomatic arrhythmia shortly after exposure. This finding highlights the importance of further reducing air pollution and taking prompt protective measures for susceptible populations during periods of elevated levels of air pollutants.\n>\n>Arrhythmia is caused by disordered electrical activity in the heart, often occurs abruptly and can lead to severe cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The Global Burden of Disease study estimated a prevalence of around 59.7 million cases of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter globally in 2019, and the disability-adjusted life years related to these 2 conditions increased from 3.79 million in 1990 to 8.39 million in 2019. Furthermore, the Cardiovascular Health and Diseases Burden Study in China reported that about 4.87 million people had atrial fibrillation in 2019. Given the considerable disease burden of arrhythmia, identifying modifiable risk factors is important.\n>\n>Air pollution has been reported to be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases; therefore, clarifying the effects of air pollution on arrhythmia is important. Air pollution is a complex mixture of particulates and gases that varies by time and location. Common air pollutants tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) and government agencies are typically known as \u201ccriteria\u201d air pollutants. Particulate matters in air pollution are broadly categorized by aerodynamic diameter as inhalable particles (< 10 \u03bcm, PM10), fine particles (< 2.5 \u03bcm, PM2.5) and coarse particles (2.5\u201310 \u03bcm, PM2.5\u201310). Criteria air pollutants that are gaseous generally include nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3). These pollutants have varied physicochemical properties and have been reported to negatively affect human health in different ways.\n>\n>Previous epidemiological studies have linked short-term exposure to air pollution with arrhythmia, but the results have been inconsistent. In addition, most of these studies evaluated the associations only at a daily level few have considered the effects of hourly exposure to air pollution before symptom onset. Associations have generally been observed in ecological time-series analyses, leading to difficulty in making causal inferences. Furthermore, no previous studies have systemically evaluated associations of criteria air pollutants with the acute onset of various types of arrhythmia episodes at a national level.\n>\n>China has air pollution levels well beyond the WHO guidelines for air quality and those measured in other countries. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the association of hourly exposure to air pollution with the acute symptomatic onset of arrhythmia in China.\n\nedit: removed footnote references from quote for clarity", "score": 1, "author": "Hrmbee"}, {"id": "jig2je8", "body": "Yeah cars release c02 and the atmosphere obsorbs it hence the smog.", "score": 0, "author": "Wrong_Ad_4043"}, {"id": "jiel427", "body": "I think microplastics in our lungs, in our digestive systems, and in our blood is far worse at this point.\n\nThe benefit to air pollution can potentially be well managed, I think plastics is just far more solidified in the global economy.", "score": -12, "author": "Bennehftw"}]}

Endotoxin tolerance is a tolerance towards pathogen components like lipopolysaccharides from bacterial cell walls. Tolerance is developed by the host to avoid strong inflammatory responses when repeatedly being in contact with these endotoxins. We hypothesized that aging is linked to a loss of this tolerance and to elevated fat content in the liver, potentially contributing to an increased risk of inflammatory diseases in the elderly. In this study, mice underwent a treatment protocol that allowed us to study the markers of tolerance in the blood and in the tissues. Based on the markers found in the blood serum and the lung tissue, the old mice showed a clear potential for endotoxin tolerance. They also showed a different fat composition in their liver compared to the young mice. Thus, we conclude that endotoxin tolerance is not necessarily affected by advanced age, but that changes in metabolic tissue homeostasis may lead to an altered immune response in old individuals. An understanding of how the immune response changes with advanced age and changed fat metabolism is important in order to understand age-related inflammatory diseases, which will help in the development of therapies for these diseases.\n\n**Abstract**\n\n(1) Background: Aging is linked to an altered immune response and metabolism. Inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis, COVID-19, and steatohepatitis are more prevalent in the elderly and steatosis is linked both to severe COVID-19 and sepsis. We hypothesized that aging is linked to a loss of endotoxin tolerance, which normally protects the host from excessive inflammation, and that this is accompanied by elevated levels of hepatic lipids. (2) Methods: An in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance model in young and old mice was used and the cytokine serum levels were measured by ELISA. Cytokine and toll-like receptor gene expression was determined by qPCR in the lungs and the liver; hepatic fatty acid composition was assessed by GC\u2013MS. (3) Results: The old mice showed a distinct potential for endotoxin tolerance as suggested by the serum cytokine levels and gene expression in the lung tissue. Endotoxin tolerance was less pronounced in the livers of the aged mice. However, the fatty acid composition strongly differed in the liver tissues of the young and old mice with a distinct change in the ratio of C18 to C16 fatty acids. (4) Conclusions: Endotoxin tolerance is maintained in advanced age, but changes in the metabolic tissue homeostasis may lead to an altered immune response in old individuals.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}, {"id": "jijw5fk", "body": "Simpler summary; y\u201dall are still working on it..", "score": 1, "author": "Exciting-Ad5774"}]}

Antipsychotic polypharmacy was compared with monotherapy in seven dosage categories (<0.4, 0.4-<0.6, 0.6-<0.9, 0.9-<1.1, 1.1-<1.4, 1.4-<1.6, and \u22651.6 defined daily doses \\[DDDs\\] per day) in terms of risk of severe physical morbidity, indicated by nonpsychiatric and cardiovascular hospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio). Within-individual analysis was used in an effort to eliminate selection bias.\n\nResults: The mean age of the cohort was 46.7 years (SD=16.0), and 50.3% (N=31,104) were men. Among patients who had used both monotherapy and polypharmacy, the risk of nonpsychiatric hospitalization was significantly lower during polypharmacy use at all total dosage categories above 1.1 DDDs/day with differences up to -13% than during monotherapy use of the same dosage category (for 1.1-<1.4 DDDs/day, adjusted hazard ratio=0.91, 95% CI=0.87-0.95; for 1.4-<1.6 DDDs/day, adjusted hazard ratio=0.91, 95% CI=0.86-0.96; and for \u22651.6 DDDs/day, adjusted hazard ratio=0.87, 95% CI=0.84-0.89). The risk of cardiovascular hospitalization was significantly lower for polypharmacy at the highest total dosage category (-18%, adjusted hazard ratio=0.82, 95% CI=0.72-0.94). The results from the comparisons between monotherapy and no use and between polypharmacy and no use were in line with the primary comparison of polypharmacy and monotherapy within the same individual. Comparison of any polypharmacy use with any monotherapy use showed no significant difference for nonpsychiatric or cardiovascular hospitalization.\n\n**Conclusions: The results show that antipsychotic monotherapy is not associated with a lower risk of hospitalization for severe physical health problems when compared with antipsychotic polypharmacy.

An ischemic deprivation of antioxidants and energy characterizes liver injury in such cases. In the face of increased reactive oxygen production, hepatocytes are vulnerable to the reperfusion driving ROS generation and multiple cell-death mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the importance of hydrogen sulfide as part of the liver's antioxidant pool and the therapeutic potency of the hydrogen sulfide donors sodium sulfide (Na2S, fast releasing) and sodium thiosulfate (STS, Na2S2O3, slow releasing). The mitoprotection and toxicity of STS and Na2S were investigated on isolated mitochondria and a liver perfusion oxidative stress model by adding text-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen sulfide donors. The respiratory capacity of mitochondria, hepatocellular released LDH, glutathione, and lipid-peroxide levels were quantified. In addition, wild-type and cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase knockout mice were subjected to warm selective ischemia-reperfusion injury by clamping the main inflow for 1 h followed by reperfusion of 1 or 24 h. A subset of animals was treated with STS shortly before reperfusion. Glutathione, plasma ALT, and lipid-peroxide levels were investigated alongside mitochondrial changes in structure (electron microscopy) and function (intravital microscopy). Liver tissue necrosis quantified 24 h after reperfusion indicates the net effects of the treatment on the organ. STS refuels and protects the endogenous antioxidant pool during liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, STS-mediated ROS scavenging significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage, resulting in better molecular and histopathological preservation of the liver tissue architecture. STS prevents tissue damage in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing the liver's antioxidant pool, thereby protecting mitochondrial integrity.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

As spermidine levels decline with age, spermidine supplementation is suggested to prevent or delay age-related diseases. However, valid pharmacokinetic data regarding spermidine remains lacking. Therefore, for the first time, the present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of oral spermidine supplementation. (2) Methods: This study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded, two-armed crossover trial with two 5-day intervention phases separated by a washout phase of 9 days. In 12 healthy volunteers, 15 mg/d of spermidine was administered orally, and blood and saliva samples were taken. Spermidine, spermine, and putrescine were quantified by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). The plasma metabolome was investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. (3) Results: Compared with a placebo, spermidine supplementation significantly increased spermine levels in the plasma, but it did not affect spermidine or putrescine levels. No effect on salivary polyamine concentrations was observed. (4) Conclusions: This study\u2019s results suggest that dietary spermidine is presystemically converted into spermine, which then enters systemic circulation. Presumably, the in vitro and clinical effects of spermidine are at least in part attributable to its metabolite, spermine. It is rather unlikely that spermidine supplements with doses <15 mg/d exert any short-term effects.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Inactivation reroutes glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, thus enabling increased NADPH generation and protection against stress. We observed that CO2/bicarbonate dramatically enhances GAPDH inactivation by H2O2, in isolation and in mammalian cells. Our findings support a mechanism involving oxidation by peroxymonocarbonate (HCO4\u2212), in which GAPDH facilitates formation and/or targeting of HCO4\u2212 to promote its own inactivation. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for CO2/bicarbonate in facilitating inactivation of GAPDH by H2O2 and rerouting glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway. They also raise the possibility that CO2 metabolism could regulate such rerouting and highlight the need to consider interplay between CO2 and H2O2 in the redox biology of mammalian cells.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) contains an active site Cys and is one of the most sensitive cellular enzymes to oxidative inactivation and redox regulation. Here, we show that inactivation by hydrogen peroxide is strongly enhanced in the presence of carbon dioxide/bicarbonate. Inactivation of isolated mammalian GAPDH by H2O2 increased with increasing bicarbonate concentration and was sevenfold faster in 25 mM (physiological) bicarbonate compared with bicarbonate-free buffer of the same pH. H2O2 reacts reversibly with CO2 to form a more reactive oxidant, peroxymonocarbonate (HCO4\u2212), which is most likely responsible for the enhanced inactivation. However, to account for the extent of enhancement, we propose that GAPDH must facilitate formation and/or targeting of HCO4\u2212 to promote its own inactivation. Inactivation of intracellular GAPDH was also strongly enhanced by bicarbonate: treatment of Jurkat cells with 20 \u00b5M H2O2 in 25 mM bicarbonate buffer for 5 min caused almost complete GAPDH inactivation, but no loss of activity when bicarbonate was not present. H2O2-dependent GAPDH inhibition in bicarbonate buffer was observed even in the presence of reduced peroxiredoxin 2 and there was a significant increase in cellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Our results identify an unrecognized role for bicarbonate in enabling H2O2 to influence inactivation of GAPDH and potentially reroute glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway and NAPDH production. They also demonstrate what could be wider interplay between CO2 and H2O2 in redox biology and the potential for variations in CO2 metabolism to influence oxidative responses and redox signaling.", "score": 3, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Many antipsychotic drugs and mood stabilizers act through restoration of the dysregulated oxidative homeostasis in the brain. However, the long-term effect of these drugs per se in terms of their potential to interfere with the oxidative status in the brain remains largely controversial. The present study aimed to investigate the sole effect of three commonly used psychoactive drugs, lithium, valproic acid, and olanzapine, on lipid and protein oxidation status in the prefrontal cortex of healthy rats. A total of 80 adult male albino Wistar rats were used, and groups were treated with saline (control), lithium, valproic acid, or olanzapine daily for 30 days. Following sacrification, right prefrontal cortexes were dissected and homogenized. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein oxidation (AOPP) assays were performed by ELISA. LPO levels were significantly higher in lithium and valproic acid-treated rats by 45% and 40%, respectively. Olanzapine treatment caused a mild 26% increase in LPO levels, but the effect was non-significant. Lithium, valproic acid, and olanzapine treatments significantly increased AOPP levels by 58%, 54%, and 36.5%, respectively. There was a strong positive correlation between the lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation levels.

The further you move up the status pyramid, the more isolated you become. Most corporations are structured like a pyramid with many low level employees and very few high level executives. This means that you have fewer people to connect with when you reach the top.\n\n3) Competition. The further up the pyramid of status or wealth you go, often you experience greater and greater competion because there are always fewer spots to be promoted into in the next higher level. This often means that friendships and connections suffer due to the zero sum game of competition.\n\n4) Time Sink. The more time you spend pursuing status and wealth (extrinsic motivations), the less time you have to spend on doing the things that you actually enjoy (intrinsic motivations). Each step up in status and wealth often comes with more responsibility and greater expectations that you will spend more time at the office. This creates a catch 22- often those with a lot of money and responsibility have no time to enjoy the fruits of their labours.\n\nEdit: and for more context- the determination of the book was that solid connections with other people is what makes people happy and healthy.", "score": 29, "author": "BioShockerInfinite"}, {"id": "jia0qkb", "body": "Well since inflation increases faster than salaries....

Much of this research has focused primarily on the atmospheric damage associated with the prompt arrival of ionizing photons within days or months of the initial outburst, and the high-energy cosmic rays that arrive thousands of years after the explosion. In this study, we turn the focus to persistent X-ray emission, arising in certain SNe that have interactions with a dense circumstellar medium and observed months and/or years after the initial outburst. The sustained high X-ray luminosity leads to large doses of ionizing radiation out to formidable distances. We assess the threat posed by these X-ray-luminous SNe for Earth-like planetary atmospheres; our results are rooted in the X-ray SN observations from Chandra, Swift-XRT, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and others. We find that this threat is particularly acute for SNe showing evidence of strong circumstellar interaction, such as Type IIn explosions, which have significantly larger ranges of influence than previously expected and lethal consequences up to \u223c50 pc away. Furthermore, X-ray-bright SNe could pose a substantial and distinct threat to terrestrial biospheres and tighten the Galactic habitable zone. We urge follow-up X-ray observations of interacting SNe for months and years after the explosion to shed light on the physical nature and full-time evolution of the emission and to clarify the danger that these events pose for life in our galaxy and other star-forming regions.", "score": 4, "author": "TurretLauncher"}, {"id": "ji9uyf7", "body": "\"dink dink\" look sparks! \"dink dink\" how the last shard of humanity surviving the superstrains will go, as it plays with the weathered remnants of a nucelar weapon.\"", "score": -2, "author": "Alternative_Hunt_138"}, {"id": "jib8ncj", "body": "So that\u2019s how the Fantastic Four got their powers.", "score": 1, "author": "Yoyodyn_Banzai_2099"}]}

Officers are also more likely to injure suspects and receive complaints about neglecting victims and violating constitutional rights. The effect is concentrated in a narrow time window following the event and is not associated with significantly lower injury risk to the officer. Together, these findings suggest that emotional responses drive the effects rather than social learning.\"\n\nThat's a pretty nice summary, as it addresses the two obvious explanations and indicates which one the evidence best seems to support.\n\nLess briefly, the two explanations are that hearing of an injury to a co-worker makes officers:  \n\n * (1) Become more fearful for their own safety and more likely use force to ensure it.  \n * (2) Become less empathetic with suspects and more likely to use force in general.\n\nSince (a) there is no reduction in injury risk, and (b) the effect is very short-term, the authors conclude (2) is the more likely explanation, which seems like solid reasoning.\n\n***\n\nHow can this finding be made actionable and used to improve outcomes?\n\nIt looks like there is increased risk to the public after an officer is injured while on duty; perhaps other officers in the social network of that officer should have support services and/or modified duty for a short time afterward?  That may allow emotion from the injury to fade or be resolved with reduced risk of it impacting the public.\n\nObviously, officers should not be using excessive force on the public *at all*, and excessive police use of force is a *massive* problem in the USA, but just saying \"don't do the bad thing\" is rarely effective as a strategy; the goal is to protect the public, so a more focused approach is likely to do so more effectively.\n\nInteresting research; hopefully it ends up meaningfully affecting policies and practices.", "score": 187, "author": "grundar"}, {"id": "ji1xwmn", "body": "[removed]", "score": 204, "author": "None"}, {"id": "ji43xys", "body": "I thought this was well known, it's a common fear/trope amongst gangs that injuring or killing a police officer will bring reprisals against the entire area for a well.", "score": 6, "author": "WeLiveInAnOceanOfGas"}, {"id": "ji4rmp0", "body": "I saw that on The Wire", "score": 4, "author": "noplacecold"}, {"id": "ji4prtq", "body": "My goal is to never be shocked at people being shocked by basic psychology.", "score": 4, "author": "Your_Favorite_Poster"}, {"id": "ji4ucjq", "body": "Oh yeah.

Previous studies have shown that seeing one's hand increases the weighting assigned to arm somatosensory inputs. In this light, we hypothesized that the sensory conflict, when tracing the contour of a shape with mirror-reversed vision, will be greater for participants who trace with a stylus seen in their hand (Hand group, n\u202f=\u202f17) than for participants who trace with the tip of rod without seen their hand (Tool group, n\u202f=\u202f15). \n\nBased on this hypothesis, we predicted that the tracing performance with mirror vision will be more deteriorated for the Hand group than for the Tool group, and we predicted a greater gating of somatosensory information for the Hand group to reduce the sensory conflict. \n\nThe participants of both groups followed the outline of a shape in two visual conditions. Direct vision: the participants saw the hand or portion of a light 40\u202fcm rod directly. Mirror Vision: the hand or the rod was seen through a mirror. We measured tracing performance using a digitizing tablet and the cortical activity with electroencephalography. Behavioral analyses revealed that the tracing performance of both groups was similarly impaired by mirror vision. \n\nHowever, contrasting the spectral content of the cortical oscillatory activity between the Mirror and Direct conditions, we observed that tracing with mirror vision resulted in significantly larger alpha (8\u201312\u202fHz) and beta (15\u201325\u202fHz) powers in the somatosensory cortex for participants of the Hand group. The somatosensory alpha and beta powers did not significantly differ between Mirror and Direct vision conditions for the Tool group. For both groups, tracing with mirror vision altered the activity of the visual cortex: decreased alpha power for the Hand group, decreased alpha and beta power for the Tool group. \n\nOverall, these results suggest that seeing the hand enhanced the sensory conflict when tracing with mirror vision and that the increase of alpha and beta powers in the somatosensory cortex served to reduce the weight assigned to somatosensory information. The increased activity of the visual cortex observed for both groups in the mirror vision condition suggests greater visual processing with increased task difficulty. \n\nFinally, the fact that the participants of the Tool group did not show better tracing performance than those of the Hand group suggests that tracing deterioration resulted from a sensorimotor conflict (as opposed to a visuo-proprioceptive conflict).", "score": 2, "author": "Homme-au-doigt"}]}

The extent by which these weather variables influence activity is intertwined with the animal\u2019s biology and may differ by species. For mosquito vectors, changes in weather can also alter host\u2013pathogen interactions thereby increasing or decreasing the burden of disease.\n\nMethods\n\nIn this study, we performed weekly mosquito surveillance throughout the active season over a 2-year period in Manitoba, Canada. We then used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to explore the relationships between weather variables over the preceding 2 weeks and mosquito trap counts for four of the most prevalent vector species in this region: Oc. dorsalis, Ae. vexans, Cx. tarsalis, and Cq. perturbans.\n\nResults\n\nMore than 265,000 mosquitoes were collected from 17 sampling sites throughout Manitoba in 2020 and 2021, with Ae. vexans the most commonly collected species followed by Cx. tarsalis. Aedes vexans favored high humidity, intermediate degree days, and low precipitation. Coquillettidia perturbans and Oc. dorsalis activity increased with high humidity and high rainfall, respectively. Culex tarsalis favored high degree days, with the relationship between number of mosquitoes captured and precipitation showing contrasting patterns between years. Minimum trapping temperature only impacted Ae. vexans and Cq. perturbans trap counts.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe activity of all four mosquito vectors was affected by weather conditions recorded in the 2 weeks prior to trapping, with each species favoring different conditions. Although some research has been done to explore the relationships between temperature/precipitation and Cx. tarsalis in the Canadian Prairies, to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate other commonly found vector species in this region. Overall, this study highlights how varying weather conditions can impact mosquito activity and in turn species-specific vector potential.", "score": 1, "author": "ColeWRS"}]}

We lack data on the consequences of LBTU on the trajectory of treatment-resistant depression (TRD).\r  \n\r  \nObjective\r  \nTo determine the prevalence of BLTU in a nationwide non-selected population of patients with TRD, to determine the rate of patients succeeding at withdrawing benzodiazepines at one year and to determine if persistent BLTU is associated with poorer mental health outcomes.\r  \n\r  \nMethod\r  \nThe FACE-TRD cohort is a national cohort of TRD patients recruited in 13 resistant depression expert centers between 2014 and 2021 and followed-up at one year. A standardized one-day long comprehensive battery was carried out, including trained-clinician and patient-reported outcomes, and patients were reevaluated at one year.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nAt baseline, 45.2% of the patients were classified in the BLTU group. In multivariate analysis, compared to patients without BLTU, patients with BLTU were more frequently classified in the \u201clow physical activity\u201d group (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\u202f=\u202f1.885, p\u202f=\u202f0.036), and had higher primary healthcare consumption (B\u202f=\u202f0.158, p\u202f=\u202f0.031) independently of age, sex and antipsychotic consumption. We found no significant difference for personality traits, suicidal ideation, impulsivity, childhood trauma exposure, earlier age at first major depressive episode, anxiety and sleep disorders (all p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Despite recommendations for withdrawal, <5% of BLTU patients withdraw benzodiazepines during the one-year follow-up. Persistent BLTU at one-year was associated with higher depression severity (B\u202f=\u202f0.189, p\u202f=\u202f0.029), higher clinical global severity (B\u202f=\u202f0.210, p\u202f=\u202f0.016), higher state-anxiety (B\u202f=\u202f0.266, p\u202f=\u202f0.003), impaired sleep quality (B\u202f=\u202f0.249, p\u202f=\u202f0.008), increased peripheral inflammation (B\u202f=\u202f0.241, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), lower functioning level (B\u202f=\u202f-0.240, p\u202f=\u202f0.006), decreased processing speed (B\u202f=\u202f-0.195, p\u202f=\u202f0.020) and verbal episodic memory (B\u202f=\u202f-0.178, p\u202f=\u202f0.048), higher absenteeism and productivity loss (B\u202f=\u202f0.595, p\u202f=\u202f0.016) and lower subjective global health status (B\u202f=\u202f-0.198, p\u202f=\u202f0.028).\r  \n\r  \nConclusion\r  \nBenzodiazepines are over-prescribed in TRD (in almost a half of the patients). Despite recommendations for withdrawal and psychiatric follow-up, <5% of patients successfully stopped taking benzodiazepines at one-year. Maintaining BLTU may contribute to the worsening of clinical and cognitive symptoms and of daily functioning in TRD patients.

At the wedding ceremony, both families invited many guests to a banquet dinner serving many live sea animals. My son was born in 2006. When he was a month old, to celebrate, we invited numerous guests for dinner again.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2008, I realized that my two-year-old son was different from children of his age in many ways. He did not communicate with others, did not look at others, walked on the balls of his feet, kept talking to himself, often made all kinds of strange movements, and kept pressing the TV and light switches, causing several switches broken. His stereotyped mechanical language and actions were continuously repetitive, over and over again. He liked rotating appliances, such as electric fans and air conditioning units, and would stare at them all the time. He did not respond when we talked to him. He had no sense of safety. He had a hard time falling asleep. While he was awake, he was super energetic. Except for bedtime, he did not stop behaving for a minute.\r  \n\r  \nThe doctor said he was developmentally delayed. His long journey to recovery began at the age of 2, hoping he would be able to return to behave like a normal kid. I ran between the hospital and the training center every day for 4 to 5 years. In the hospital he was receiving various medical treatments. In the training center, he received sensory integration training, took Chinese herbal medicines, received acupuncture, etc. We did not dare to get behind with any of the treatments that could possibly be helpful for children with mental disorders. Whenever I learned of a new treatment, I would try it on him like grabbing a life-saving straw. I was afraid that my child would miss out on the best treatment available.\r  \n\r  \nAll the above treatments and rehabilitations brought little progress to him. He simply could not learn through his perception of the outside world, nor did he have the ability to comprehend. Whenever we tried to teach him something, he didn't remember anything we had just finished teaching.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2011, he was 5 years old, and I took him to see Dr. Zou, a well-known autism specialist at Sun Yat-sen University. Dr. Zou said that he was moderately autistic, had ADHD, and needed long-term intervention and guidance training at home. In fact, he was not only autistic and hyperactive, but also acquired fevers, colds and coughs quite often. A slight cough could develop into pneumonia. His treatment, training, and illness resulted in great economic pressure and mental stress for my family. At that time, we would spend more than ten thousand CNY ($1,500-1,600) per month just for his health care costs alone.\r  \n\r  \nOn December 22, 2011, results of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children indicated: his verbal IQ score 61, which was lower than 99.5% of the population; operational IQ score 89, which was less than 76.1% of the population; and overall IQ less than 96.7% of the population.\r  \n\r  \nHe had to change kindergartens five times because his ADHD affected other children. His doctor prescribed Tomoxetine hydrochloride in order to keep him quiet in kindergarten. This medication treats the symptoms but not the fundamental cause. As soon as the medication was stopped, the hyperactivity started again. Side effects of this medication were lack of appetite, weakness and weight loss.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2012, he turned 6 years old. The doctor said he was already so old and I should consider stopping these treatments because it would be useless to treat him any more. After he started elementary school, I had to accompany him and sit next to him in class because he didn't have any sense of rules or self-control. He was particularly fierce, never stopped for a minute, stood up at any time in class to get something from his classmates, talked and screamed, made a lot of noise, danced and made all kinds of weird motions with his hands. I couldn't control his behavior at all. I had to face the strange looks from the teacher and his classmates. I felt I could find no place to hide myself.\r  \n\r  \nAfter studying Buddhism, I realized that this is a spiritual disease, a medical incurable illness.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2014, I heard people say that ASD and ADHD are karmic diseases, so I started looking for information online to study Buddhism. I recited whichever sutra people on the internet said was good. Although I made these efforts, my child remained unchanged. However, through studying Buddhism I understood the truth of the previous, present, and future lives, which substantially eased my mind.\r  \n\r  \nIn early 2016, I inadvertently clicked on a WeChat group link (WeChat is the social media known as Weixin in China). It happened to be a video program about ASD and ADHD sponsored by Master Lu, who is watching totems for patients. After watching it in detail, I was shocked. I immediately started to practice the three Golden Buddhist Practices of making vows, reciting scriptures, and performing life liberation, to treat my child. Then, I made the following 2 vows:\r  \n1. Become a vegetarian for the sake of my son for the rest of my life; to transfer my son all my merits and virtues of being a vegetarian to help him to eliminate his karma;\r  \n2. Performing life liberation for my child every month.\r  \nMy daily recitation was Great Compassion Mantra, Heart Sutra, Mantra to Untie Karmic Knots, Amitabha Pure Land Rebirth Mantra 49 times each, and Eighty-eight Buddhas Great Repentance 5 times per day.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I started to recite the Little Houses, I often dreamed of being chased, and constrained by spirits in bed. Whenever this happened, Master Lu\u2019s Dharmakaya would appear in the dream to save me. After reciting approximately 200 Little Houses for my son's creditors, his behavior improved substantially. His eyes were able to settle, sometimes he would look at people, his verbal skills improved, and he was able to have a simple conversation with others for two or three rounds. This gave me a lot of confidence and motivation. I tried my best to recite the scriptures every day; I even wanted to spare all my sleeping time and recite instead.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2018, after two years of practicing Buddhism, all his skills had improved tremendously, especially behavior control. I did not have to chaperone him at school anymore and I was finally relieved.\r  \n\r  \nOn February 5, 2021, the results of the Wechsler-IV test showed that he had an overall IQ score of 100. The doctor told me that his intelligence was completely normal. At that moment, tears fell from my eyes, and I could not express my gratitude to Master Lu and Guan Yin Bodhisattva.\r  \n\r  \nI am grateful to the great and compassionate Guan Yin Bodhisattva for the blessings. She has bestowed on me and my son, who had deep and heavy karmic obstacles. Buddha is the great healer! From 2016 to 2021, the five years I have steadily implemented the four Golden Buddhist Practices into my daily life, I have been cultivating my mind and my behavior; making wows and recycling performing vows. In sum, I have recited over 6,000 Little Houses and released 60,000 to 70,000 fish for my son.

In Charleston, South Carolina, and the Chesapeake Bay, it\u2019s up to 5 millimeters (a fifth of an inch). In some areas of Delaware, it\u2019s as much as twice that.\n>\n>Five millimeters of annual sea-level rise along a stretch of coastline, plus 5 millimeters of subsidence there, is effectively 10 millimeters of relative sea-level rise. Atlantic coastal cities are already suffering from persistent flooding, and the deluge will only get worse as they sink while seas rise. Yet high-resolution subsidence data like this isn\u2019t yet taken into account for coastal hazard assessments. \u201cWhat we want to do here is to really bring awareness about this missing component, that based on our analysis actually makes the near-future vulnerability a lot worse than what you would expect from sea-level rise alone,\u201d says Manoochehr Shirzaei, an environmental security expert at Virginia Tech and coauthor of the new paper.\n>\n>...\n>\n>The primary cause of dramatic land subsidence is over-extracting groundwater from it, which makes the terrain collapse like an empty water bottle. In San Jose, California, this has lowered the elevation by as much as 12 feet. The combination of sea-level rise and subsidence could inundate up to 165 square miles of Bay Area coastline by 2100, according to Shirzaei\u2019s previous research. Parts of Jakarta are sinking 10 inches a year, forcing Indonesia to move its capital elsewhere. Extracting oil also causes subsidence, a particularly acute problem in the Houston-Galveston area. And landfill or sediments along coastlines can also settle over time.\n>\n>While scientists have been aware that US coastlines are sinking, they haven\u2019t had much data to show local differences in rates. Subsidence varies significantly even over short distances, given variations in the underlying geology and nearby human activity. For this new paper, Shirzaei and lead author Leonard Ohenhen, also an environmental security expert at Virginia Tech, used data from a highly sensitive satellite that fired radar signals at the Earth, then analyzed what bounced back to determine coastal deformation. They did this for the years between 2007 and 2020, along 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) of the Atlantic coast.\n>\n>The researchers found particularly intense subsidence in agricultural areas, where groundwater is extracted to feed crops\u2014which in turn will be more vulnerable to flooding as the elevation drops. They also found that most Atlantic coastal cities are seeing over 3 millimeters of subsidence a year, including Boston and New York City. As the elevation falls, it destabilizes above-ground infrastructure like buildings and roads, as well as buried pipes and cables.\n>\n>\u201cThree millimeters a year seems like a really tiny number,\u201d says Ohenhen, but what really matters is \u201cthe cumulative effect of how much sinking will occur over the years.\u201d And it could get worse, he predicts. \u201cThe East Coast is one of the fastest-growing areas for the US in terms of population. When you have more population, it means people will use more water, and that will increase how fast the land is sinking.\u201d\n>\n>...\n>\n>The good news is that subsidence can be halted, first by stopping the overextraction of groundwater, then ideally by pumping water back into the ground. But if the human population keeps growing, there will be more demand for water, especially if certain regions receive less rainfall due to climate change. This groundwater is also threatened by seawater intrusion. Restoring the coastal ecosystems that naturally buffer against storm surges and rising sea levels could help keep that water supply drinkable. \u201cNumber one is just ensuring as much as we can that our wetlands stay healthy,\u201d says Natalie Snider, associate vice president of the Climate Resilient Coasts and Watersheds program at the Environmental Defense Fund, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new paper.\n\nThis research serves as a good reminder for policymakers that when looking at coastal flooding risks that it's also necessary to consider what is happening to the land adjacent as well. Conventional wisdom seems to treat landforms as static elements within the environment, but a deeper or longer-term look shows that they are anything but.

However, high-resolution observations and models of coastal subsidence are scarce, hindering an accurate vulnerability assessment. We use satellite data from 2007 to 2020 to create high-resolution map of subsidence rate at mm-level accuracy for different land covers along the ~3,500\u2009km long US Atlantic coast. Here, we show that subsidence rate exceeding 3\u2009mm per year affects most coastal areas, including wetlands, forests, agricultural areas, and developed regions.

Cannabis users in this study experienced stroke and MI at higher rates than non-users, with 29% higher MIs, 35% higher strokes, and a 47% higher rate of pooled CV events. Haemorrhagic strokes were higher by 103%. \n\nWhat this study was unable to do is show that those increases were not due to random chance, beyond the arbitrary threshold for \"statistical significance\", which is set at 1 in 20. Put another way there is a greater than 1 in 20 chance that the increased rate of strokes and MIs in cannabis users in this study was down to random chance, rather than a real cannabis user effect. The odds that the increased rate of pooled cardiovascular events was is down to chance is about 1 in 19, though that is the result closest to statistical significance.\n\nWhy were they not able to demonstrate that these apparently quite large changes in rate were not down to chance, despite the large study size? There are a bunch of factors I suspect. There was a high amount of variability in the groups looked at in the individual studies in the meta-analysis, which makes the statistics more uncertain. While the headline numbers are very high, the numbers more relevant to the statistics were much lower as rates of events were low, and there were a lot fewer users than non-users.\n\nThere are also a bunch of pretty large caveats around the study. Patient population was overwhelmingly young and female, with short lengths of follow up where done. As such this study is limited evidence regarding CV events in older patients and men. Funnel plots for pooled CV events also suggests a publication bias towards negative studies. Then there are the massive difficulties involved in meshing together so much data from multiple sources, and issues with controlling for confounding. It appears the raw event data has been pulled from the underlying studies, losing any adjustments for confounding factors done in the initial studies, and no controlling has been done subsequently which has meaningfully changed the outcomes of some studies. For example in the study by San (2020), the raw data shows a 50% reduction in ischemic stroke, but controlling for simple confounders eliminates this entirely. This is concerning when the meta-analysis naively works from the raw data.\n\nE/ This study has asked the question \"with this data, can we prove beyond reasonable doubt that Cannabis **causes** MIs and strokes?\", and based on the data they have come to the reasonable conclusion that they cannot, but it is very important to not take this as proof of the inverse. The study has not tried to prove that there **are not** meaningful effects from cannabis, and it is very clear from the data that if you ran those calculations this data would not be able to prove that either.

We found that people\u2019s trust in email writers decreased when they were told that AI was involved in the writing process.Surprisingly trust increased when AI was used for writing more interpersonal emails (as opposed to more transactional ones).

That\u2019s kind of at a surface level of what is possible. AI art. Prompt = picture. But the user shapes the result, the machine does the drawing. \n\nI then got invited to DALL-E 2 after a short waitlist. I had seen a video of what the more advanced artists working with OpenAI were able to do with full toolset. \n\nI learned to use it over a few sessions and how prompts work for style and results. It is sort of unpredictable sometimes which is actually part of the fun IMO. It doesn\u2019t always give you what you ask for or some weird interpretation of what you did, so when using the more advanced tools (mainly a featured called out-painting) it gets interesting for what you can make.\n\nWhen I was first using dall-e 2, it makes scenes on what you ask of it. It\u2019s doing a lot of the artistic control based on human input. That was just square frames with one prompt. I got this criticism that I wasn\u2019t actually making anything, but without me+ the tool it doesn\u2019t.  But they had a point, these are creative industry people. I get their gripe, like the artists that were winning contests against hand drawn/painted pieces.   It\u2019s just a neat trick. There should be separate categories for contests to keep things fair and without hatred at a tool. You can use it as a parlor trick or you can use it as a tool to make some cool and unique stuff, once you gain control of how it works and what it can do. \n\nSo I learned more as the month went on and started making simple multi frame multi prompt out-paintings where I was really gaining control of the tool.

I put myself to work to start using the tool like a collage maker and to use it in a more advanced way by making scenes, controlling the style, building a higher res scene with more prompts on a larger canvas. Then began using it where it fell short with the prompt editing tools to make custom collage elements based on what I needed. It gives four results per prompt, so sometimes I got many usable elements.\n\nThen I started using photoshop to combine and add these elements in with feathered selections, scaled and placed to make scenes with depth; scenes that I was imaging then bringing to life with the tools. In a sort of hybrid \u201cwhat I want/what I get with what it gives me with my credits that cost money\u201d and got some awesome results. Started doing some photoshop based effects and I can upscale it later if I need to. I was also making some super resolution elements with AI upscale to composite in to the larger canvases. \n\nI started feeling like I was making something unique. The messed part is the creative industry people still treat it like lesser than; when without me with the tool the output cannot exist with what a machine does by itself. It is a unique and original piece. Based on massive data training sets, but still not seen before. Not copying someone\u2019s style. Making one of my own.\n\nThis went to the point where a big time comic book colorist friend was going to put some lightning on one for me since I was having trouble with a non ideal workstation to do that effect by hand. He then got scared that he would be blacklisted if people heard he had put a hint of color on an \u201cAI piece.\u201d If I get a real workstation to control my mouse, I can do it myself. I just thought that attitude toward AI was a bit much since people really feel it\u2019s not making anything. Since it often is somewhere in that valley of it with you helping, rather than you with it helping. \n\nI understand it, since I feel that way about some of the users cracking out single frame images of really polished looking stuff like robot women and stuff. But it\u2019s so uninspired sometimes.\n\nA friend has a small following on instagram and he\u2019s really good using different tools, but it\u2019s more of those single images/prompts type result.   \n\nI also made a few out-paintings with my original art as the seed frame and those were pretty cool.\n\nI\u2019ll post some if anyone wants to see the progression.", "score": 1, "author": "WoodenSporkAudio"}, {"id": "jhtk46r", "body": "\"Humans value expressions of humanity over expressions of artificial intelligence \"\n\nYes.

Causes of sudden death in young people within 30 days of their COVID-19 vaccination were also examined.\n\nShe said the combination of Australia's high rates of community vaccination (98.1% receiving a first dose of COVID-19 vaccination), prolonged lockdowns and relatively low community COVID-19 transmission created an optimal setting to assess OHCA rates following the introduction of widespread vaccination.\n\nThe study examined data from the EndUCD registry, which investigates all OHCAs aged 1\u201350 years in Victoria, looking at data from April 2019 to March 2022, with comprehensive adjudication against hospital and forensic data, thereby providing far more granular detail than other similar studies in the world.\n\nShe said three time periods were defined\u2014before the pandemic (April 2019\u2013Feb 2020); during the pandemic but preceding vaccine availability (March 2020\u2013January 2021); and the third period correlating to both COVID-19 presence in the community and vaccine availability (Feb 2021\u2013March 2022). These time periods were compared against age-specific vaccination and COVID-19 rates for Victorians aged 1\u201350 years on a monthly basis.\n\nDr. Paratz said the primary outcome was comparison of the defined time periods against OHCA rates, unascertained OHCA or OHCA due to myocarditis. The second outcome was causes of young sudden death within 30 days of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n2,242 people experienced OHCA during the study period (unascertained OHCA = 233, myocarditis causing OHCA =13). No variation was seen in median monthly rates of OHCA, myocarditis causing OHCA or unascertained OHCA according to the defined time periods.\n\nhttps://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-04-association-out-of-hospital-cardiac-covid-vaccination.html", "score": 71, "author": "Wagamaga"}, {"id": "jhtdgk3", "body": "This needs to be pinned to the top of every conservative/ anti vaxx subreddit.", "score": 79, "author": "Globaltheodolite"}, {"id": "jhtw77c", "body": "Sponsored by big aeorta", "score": 18, "author": "lostredditacc"}, {"id": "jhtq3bv", "body": "This is wrong if you use the \"Florida Rational\".

The data for this study came from a comprehensive household population survey of 1,064 adults living in 16 neighborhoods in Dublin City (Ireland) and its suburbs. We used multigroup structural equation modeling to analyze the direct and indirect effects of walkability on happiness, mediated by health, trust, and satisfaction with neighborhood appearance. We found living in a walkable neighborhood was directly linked to the happiness of people aged 36 to 45 (p = .001) and, to a lesser extent, those aged 18 to 35 (p = .07). For older adults, we found that walkable places mattered for happiness indirectly. Such built environments enhanced the likelihood that residents felt more healthy and more trusting of others, and this in turn affected the happiness of older people living in walkable neighborhoods.\r  \n\r  \nTakeaway for practice\r  \nWe found that the way neighborhoods are planned and maintained mattered for happiness, health, and trust. Our findings suggest that mixed-use neighborhood designs that enable residents to shop and socialize within walking distance to their homes have direct and indirect effects on happiness.

Two components come together at the wound to form a clot, without doing so elsewhere in the body where it might be dangerous.\n\nTraumatic events like car crashes can cause internal bleeding, and if patients don\u2019t reach a hospital in time they can be fatal. Finding ways to stop the bleeding can extend that window, potentially saving lives.\n\nThe [MIT team](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adhm.202202756) has now developed a synthetic system that could be injected by first responders to stem internal bleeding. It does so using nanoparticles and polymers that work to boost the formation of natural blood clots.\n\nNormally, cells called platelets are attracted to the site of a wound, where they trigger a cascade of processes that form a sticky clot. A protein called fibrinogen is also important for maintaining the structure of these clots.\n\nThe new system is made up of two major components \u2013 nanoparticles that recruit platelets, and a polymer that mimics fibrinogen. The nanoparticles are made of a biocompatible material called PEG-PLGA, and have a peptide that helps them bind to activated platelets. This means that they accumulate where there are higher concentrations of platelets, such as wounds, and work to draw even more to the area. The size of these nanoparticles has also been optimized to be between 140 and 220 nanometers, which keeps them from building up in organs like the lungs where clots can be dangerous.", "score": 48, "author": "chrisdh79", "page_title": "Just a moment..."}, {"id": "jhrvcbn", "body": "Is stuff like this immediately available to medical professionals on the field?

In the early experimentation, it would appear that it doesn't increase the risk of radical thrombus formation, which was my first big concern.  That's been the biggest hurdle for most injectable hemostatic agents.  That being said, this study also doesn't examine adverse events in the mice, and it was a very small group.  Not a fault of the researchers, as this is mainly a proof of concept publication.  \n\nOperating under the assumptions that it is safe and effective in stopping internal bleeding in humans, there are still some logistical challenges that may limit its potential.  \n\nCost is a huge factor in medicine.  Whether public or private funded, the almighty dollar (or pound, euro....) will always have a say.  While these types of injuries happen, they're not as common of an occurrence as one would imagine.  This means that the medication may sit unused on shelves for months.  The current broad use treatment is Tranexamic Acid, which has an average cost of $11/dose.  If it expires and gets tossed, not a huge deal, so hospitals and ambulance operators will carry quite a bit on hand.  If this ends up.being in the thousands of dollars, it may be hard to justify carrying it on an Ambulance that may never use it, and private companies may decide not to carry it at all due to cost if expired (they can bill for what they use, but they can't bill for what they don't).\n\nSecondly is storage.  Most ambulances don't have cold storage, so carrying anything requiring refrigeration is out.  They also bounce down the road, vibrate and are generally a violent environment for anything stored inside of them, so if this is temperature or vibration sensitive, that would severely limit the utility of it in an EMS setting.  \n\nFinally, ease of use.  Especially for an EMS crew, a crashing trauma patient is a handful, and often it is just 2 providers caring for the individual.  If it requires complex measuring and mixing, this becomes a really big challenge operationally.  Compounding this is working in a moving ambulance.  Even basic fine motor skills can become very challenging on rough roads, windy conditions or winding roads.  Having to pull over to perform a task is not ideal with patients where definitive intervention is surgical.

Here's the abstract:\n\nAbstract\n\nTAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is a key feature of over 95% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and nearly half of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. The pathogenic mechanisms of TDP-43 dysfunction are poorly understood, however, activation of cell stress pathways may contribute to pathogenesis. We, therefore, sought to identify which cell stress components are critical for driving disease onset and neurodegeneration in ALS and FTD.\n\nWe studied the rNLS8 transgenic mouse model, which expresses human TDP-43 with a genetically-ablated nuclear localisation sequence within neurons of the brain and spinal cord resulting in cytoplasmic TDP-43 pathology and progressive motor dysfunction. Amongst numerous cell stress-related biological pathways profiled using qPCR arrays, several critical integrated stress response (ISR) effectors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding homologous protein (Chop/Ddit3) and activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4), were upregulated in the cortex of rNLS8 mice prior to disease onset.\n\nThis was accompanied by early up-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2 and diverse pro-apoptotic genes including BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid). However, pro-apoptotic signalling predominated after onset of motor phenotypes. Notably, pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 protein was elevated in the cortex of rNLS8 mice at later disease stages, suggesting that downstream activation of apoptosis drives neurodegeneration following failure of early protective responses. Unexpectedly, suppression of Chop in the brain and spinal cord using antisense oligonucleotide-mediated silencing had no effect on overall TDP-43 pathology or disease phenotypes in rNLS8 mice.\n\nCytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation therefore causes very early activation of ISR and both anti- and pro-apoptotic signalling that switches to predominant pro-apoptotic activation later in disease. These findings suggest that precise temporal modulation of cell stress and death pathways may be beneficial to protect against neurodegeneration in ALS and FTD.", "score": 1, "author": "a-buss"}]}

Following two challenging cognitive tasks, participants received negative and neutral feedback in a face-to-face evaluation situation. Receiving negative feedback decreased self-reported positive affect and dominance, slowed heart rate, and amplified fEMG activity related to frowning and eye constriction. Although self-reported emotional reactions were unrelated to grandiose narcissism, fEMG activity associated with negative affect was significantly enhanced by grandiose narcissism.

In addition, we found that n-3 PUFAs can significantly decrease serum triglyceride levels (SMD= \u22120.39; 95% CI: \u22120.59 \\~ \u22120.18, I2 = 17.2%), systolic blood pressure (SMD = \u22120.54; 95% CI: \u22120.86 \\~ \u22120.22, I2 = 48.6%), and diastolic blood pressure (SMD = \u22120.56; 95% CI: \u22120.79 \\~ 0.33, I2 = 14.0%) in patients with metabolic syndrome. The results from the sensitivity analysis confirmed that our results were robust.

Significant correlations were found between PUFA levels (specific omega-6/omega-3 ratios), the ratio of omega-6-derived calories to the total amount of calories and reading scores. Mediation analysis showed a mediating effect of fatty acids on the association between reading speed scores and nutritional status. Moderation analysis, moreover, showed that the associations of omega-6/omega-3 ratios in the blood and Kcal omega-6/Kcal total in dietary intake were moderated by reading speed performances. Results of the mediation and moderation models confirm that the associations of dietary intake with PUFA levels in the blood vary depending on learning abilities. Reading skills appear to be sensitive to the effects of a complex set of favorable conditions related to the presence of higher omega-3 blood levels. These conditions may reflect the action of dietary as well as genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.*\r  \nKeywords: **PUFAs; reading; writing; phonological awareness; dyslexia; dietary intake; omega-3; omega-6; omega-6/omega-3 ratio; blood PUFAs**", "score": 1, "author": "True_Garen"}]}

The preventive effect of NAT in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) mice was further evaluated. Aging related indicators, neuropathology, gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in cecal contents were analyzed.\n\n**Results**\n\nNAT treatment extended the lifespan of these mice by up to 33.3 %. Furthermore, these mice showed the improved aging characteristics and decreased injuries in cerebral neurons. Dietary NAT significantly delayed DNA damage in the brain, and inhibited reduction of tight junction protein in the colon. A significant increase at gut bacterial genus level (such as Lactobacillus, Butyricimonas, and Akkermansia) accompanied by increasing concentrations of SCFAs in cecal contents was observed after NAT treatment. Functional profiling of gut microbiota composition indicated that NAT treatment regulated the glucolipid and bile acid-related metabolic pathways. Interestingly, NAT treatment ameliorated cognitive impairment, attenuated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and Tau pathology, and regulated the gut microbiota composition and SCFAs receptor-related pathway of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) mice.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nNAT mitigated age-associated cerebral injury in mice through gut-brain axis.

The residue-level secondary-structure design model generally yields higher accuracy and more diverse sequences. These findings suggest unexplored opportunities for protein designs and functional outcomes within the vast amino acid sequences beyond known proteins. Our models, based on an attention-based diffusion model and trained on a dataset extracted from experimentally known 3D protein structures, offer numerous downstream applications in the conditional generative design of various biological or engineering systems. Future work could include additional conditioning and an exploration of other functional properties of the generated proteins for various properties beyond structural objectives.*", "score": 1, "author": "Holiday_Afternoon_13"}]}

However, the temporal relationship between the two is less understood. Does depression lead to cannabis use, or does cannabis use lead to depression, or is it a combination of both? Furthermore, this directionality is confounded by other substance use, specifically binge drinking, which is common during adolescence. This study aimed to examine the temporal directionality of cannabis use and depression among a prospective, longitudinal, sequential cohort of 15 to 24-year-olds. Data were drawn from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study. The final sample included 767 participants. Multilevel regression models were run to assess concurrent (at the same time point) and prospective (1 year later) associations between cannabis use and depression. When measured concurrently, depressive symptoms did not significantly predict past-month cannabis use but did significantly predict more days of use among cannabis users. Prospective associations indicated that depressive symptoms significantly predicted cannabis use 1 year later and cannabis use significantly predicted depressive symptoms 1 year later. We found no evidence that these associations varied by age or binge drinking.

We collected demographic, epidemiologic information and dried blood spot (DBS) samples that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using recombinant nucleocapsid (NC) and spike (SP) proteins with a Luminex technology.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nSamples were obtained from 1386 and 1425 participants in Guinea and Cameroon, respectively. The overall age-standardized SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence against SP and NC was 71.57% (95% CI: 67.48-75.33) in Guinea and 74.71% (95% CI: 71.99-77.25) in Cameroon. Seroprevalence increased significantly with age categories. Female participants were more likely to be seropositive than male. The seroprevalence in unvaccinated participants was 69.6% (95%CI; 65.5-73.41) in Guinea and 74.8% (95%CI; 72.04-77.38) in Cameroon). In multivariate analysis, only age, sex and education degree were independently associated with seropositivity.\r  \n\r  \nConclusion\r  \nThese findings show a high community transmission after the different epidemiological waves including Omicron especially among people above 40 years old. In addition, our results suggest that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been underestimated as a significant proportion of the population has already contracted the virus and that vaccine strategies should focus on vulnerable populations.", "score": 2, "author": "PHealthy"}]}

Many scientists have assumed (somewhat reasonably) that when people arrive at the correct answer on a reflection test question, they did so only after falling for the trick. This view is often called \"***default interventionism***\": people have a \"default\" response that they need to \"intervene\" (or \"reflect\") on in order to get to the correct answer. Surprisingly, typical experiments don't actually test this assumption because typical experiments only observe people's final response on reflection tests. Two new studies (N \u2245 200) tested this assumption by recording all the thoughts people verbalized on their way to their final answer on such trick questions. Turns out that 20-30% of correct responses didn't involve falling for the trick! This suggests that the \"default interventionist\" account is not an exhaustive explanation of how people complete these trick questions.

We found that patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or frontotemporal dementia have aberrant TDP-43 accumulation in hippocampal astrocytes. In mouse models, induction of widespread or hippocampus-targeted accumulation in astrocytic TDP-43 caused progressive memory loss and localized changes in antiviral gene expression. These changes were cell-autonomous and correlated with impaired astrocytic defense against infectious viruses. Among the changes, astrocytes had elevated levels of interferon-inducible chemokines, and neurons had elevated levels of the corresponding chemokine receptor CXCR3 in presynaptic terminals. CXCR3 stimulation altered presynaptic function and promoted neuronal hyperexcitability, akin to the effects of astrocytic TDP-43 dysregulation, and blockade of CXCR3 reduced this activity.

The convective currents flow in patterns generated by the planet's rotation, the inner core, and the Coriolis effect. This self sustaining geodynamo creates the planet's magnetosphere.\n\nNASA's InSIGHT probe has revealed that Mars' core is larger and less dense than previously thought, implying the presence of additional lighter elements such as hydrogen. Previous measurements from meteorites has also shown us that it's potentially rich in sulfur too. If it really does contain more hydrogen, then the hydrogen in Mar's (Fe-S-H) core might play a role in the collapse of Mars' magnetic field. Initial mixing would have been a liquid of Fe-S-H and thus able to generate convective currents that drove the magnetosphere early on, but over time, under those kinds of pressures, the liquids separate into two immiscible bodies, one rich in S (Fe-S) and the other rich in H (Fe-H) which effectively shuts off any convection. A recent paper, Figure 3 states the following:\n\n>While separated denser liquids stayed at the deepest part, lighter liquids migrated upward and mixed with the bulk liquid core, which could drive Martian core convection. At the same time, gravitationally stable, compositional stratification should have developed in a region where liquid separation took place. Eventually, Mars\u2019 entire core became stratified, which ceased convection. It is known that Mars\u2019 planetary magnetic field was present until ~4 gigayears ago and was then lost. The separation of immiscible S-rich and H-rich liquids could have been responsible for both the onset and termination of Martian core convection and dynamo action. Observing the structure of the Martian core, possibly via the ongoing InSight mission will validate this scenario.\n\nSee: [Stratification in planetary cores by liquid immiscibility in Fe-S-H](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28274-z)", "score": 1, "author": "GeoGeoGeoGeo", "page_title": "Stratification in planetary cores by liquid immiscibility in Fe-S-H | Nature Communications"}]}

The polls showed that over 50% of participants actually believe that climate change is happening either now or in the near future and that it will impact their local areas, not just faraway places.\n\nThe team also looked at the results of several studies designed to test the relationship between psychological distance and climate action. Out of 26 reviewed studies, only nine found a positive association between psychological distance and climate action. In fact, some studies showed that viewing climate change as impacting distant places and communities made people want to take more action. The researchers also found that 25 out of 30 studies failed to prove that experimentally decreasing psychological distance increased climate action.\n\nThe pervasive misconception about the relationship between psychological distance and climate action could actually be impeding progress in mitigating climate change due to social influence, suggest the authors. For example, if people think others perceive climate change as psychologically distant and therefore aren't taking action, they might be less likely to act themselves. Also, they might think that their efforts are futile because real environmental change relies on the combined efforts of many.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/04/230421112646.htm", "score": 61, "author": "Wagamaga"}, {"id": "jhe72sw", "body": "Aussie here.\n\nI lived through the 2019 bushfires.

Loss of autophagy contributes to cytotoxicity and tissue degeneration, but the mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive.

ATG5\u2212/\u2212 neurons exhibit basal cytotoxicity accompanied by metabolic defects. Depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) due to hyperactivation of NAD-consuming enzymes is found to trigger cell death via mitochondrial depolarization in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 neurons. Boosting intracellular NAD levels improves cell viability by restoring mitochondrial bioenergetics and proteostasis in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 neurons.

In the older individuals with obesity, the mitochondrial network was more fragmented overall compared to young healthy lean individuals and completely lacked 24 h rhythmicity, which was also true for the mitochondrial respiratory capacity\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nOur data shows a paralleled rhythmicity between mitochondrial network morphology and mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which oscillates over the course of a mimicked real-life day in human skeletal muscle of young, healthy lean individuals. In older individuals with obesity, the lack of a 24-hour rhythmicity in mitochondrial network connectivity was also aligned with a lack in respiratory capacity. This suggests that 24-hour rhythmicity in mitochondrial network connectivity is a determinant of rhythmicity in mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Thus, restoring mitochondrial network integrity may promote mitochondrial respiratory capacity and hence contribute to blunting the metabolic aberrations in individuals with a disturbed 24-hour rhythmicity in metabolism, like older individuals with obesity.", "score": 3, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Analysis of 40 common human brain diseases identifies 5 major transcriptional patterns, representing tumor-related, neurodegenerative, psychiatric and substance abuse, and 2 mixed groups of diseases affecting basal ganglia and hypothalamus. Further, for diseases with enriched expression in cortex, single-nucleus data in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) exhibits a cell type expression gradient separating neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and substance abuse diseases, with unique excitatory cell type expression differentiating psychiatric diseases. Through mapping of homologous cell types between mouse and human, most disease risk genes are found to act in common cell types, while having species-specific expression in those types and preserving similar phenotypic classification within species.

Unfortunately, their break down products pollute our environment, leading to widespread contamination with micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). The blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) is an important biological barrier that protects the brain from harmful substances. In our study we performed short term uptake studies in mice with orally administered polystyrene micro-/nanoparticles (9.55 \u00b5m, 1.14 \u00b5m, 0.293 \u00b5m). We show that nanometer sized particles\u2014but not bigger particles\u2014reach the brain within only 2 h after gavage. To understand the transport mechanism, we performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of DOPC bilayers with a polystyrene nanoparticle in the presence and absence of various coronae. We found that the composition of the biomolecular corona surrounding the plastic particles was critical for passage through the BBB. Cholesterol molecules enhanced the uptake of these contaminants into the membrane of the BBB, whereas the protein model inhibited it. These opposing effects could explain the passive transport of the particles into the brain.\n\nGraphic abstract:\n\nhttps://pub.mdpi-res.com/nanomaterials/nanomaterials-13-01404/article\\_deploy/html/images/nanomaterials-13-01404-ag.png", "score": 5, "author": "Homme-au-doigt", "page_title": "404 Not Found"}, {"id": "jhb39n3", "body": "Good thing I'm smart enough not to eat the food packaging.", "score": 5, "author": "Just_Tradition_7652"}, {"id": "jhaz4fk", "body": "Plastic passing the blood brain barrier.

Our discovery of a method that may heal wounds up to three times faster can be a game changer for diabetic and elderly people, among others, who often suffer greatly from wounds that won\u2019t heal,\u201d said Maria Asplund, Associate Professor of Bioelectronics at Chalmers University of Technology and head of research on the project.\n\nThe researchers worked from an old hypothesis that electric stimulation of damaged skin can be used to heal wounds. The idea is that skin cells are electrotactic, which means that they directionally \u2018migrate\u2019 in electric fields. This means that if an electric field is placed in a petri dish with skin cells, the cells stop moving randomly and start moving in the same direction. The researchers investigated how this principle can be used to electrically guide the cells in order to make wounds heal faster. Using a tiny engineered chip, the researchers were able to compare wound healing in artificial skin, stimulating one wound with electricity and letting one heal without electricity. The differences were striking. \n\n\u201cWe were able to show that the old hypothesis about electric stimulation can be used to make wounds heal significantly faster. In order to study exactly how this works for wounds, we developed a kind of biochip on which we cultured skin cells, which we then made tiny wounds in. Then we stimulated one wound with an electric field, which clearly led to it healing three times as fast as the wound that healed without electric stimulation,\u201d Asplund commented. \nhttps://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/LC/D2LC01045C", "score": 50, "author": "Wagamaga"}, {"id": "jha4ri6", "body": "I remember reading about using electricity to heal wounds decades ago.

Profiling of patient-derived PDAC models revealed that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and MUFA-linked ether phospholipids play a critical role in maintaining ROS homeostasis. We show that ether phospholipids support mitochondrial supercomplex assembly and ROS production; accordingly, blocking de novo ether phospholipid biosynthesis sensitized PDAC cells to complex I inhibition by inducing mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxidation. These data identify ether phospholipids as a regulator of mitochondrial redox control that contributes to the sensitivity of PDAC cells to complex I inhibition.", "score": 4, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Irreversible electroporation (IRE), a non-thermal method of tumor ablation, is used in treatment of select patients with locally-advanced unresectable PC and has potentiated the effect of certain immunotherapies. Yeast-derived particulate \u03b2-glucan induces trained innate immunity and successfully reduces murine PC tumor burden. This study tests the hypothesis that IRE may augment \u03b2-glucan induced trained immunity in the treatment of PC.\n\n**Methods** \u03b2-Glucan-trained pancreatic myeloid cells were evaluated ex vivo for trained responses and antitumor function after exposure to ablated and unablated tumor-conditioned media. \u03b2-Glucan and IRE combination therapy was tested in an orthotopic murine PC model in wild-type and Rag\u2212/\u2212 mice. Tumor immune phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. Effect of oral \u03b2-glucan in the murine pancreas was evaluated and used in combination with IRE to treat PC. The peripheral blood of patients with PC taking oral \u03b2-glucan after IRE was evaluated by mass cytometry.\n\n**Results** IRE-ablated tumor cells elicited a potent trained response ex vivo and augmented antitumor functionality. In vivo, \u03b2-glucan in combination with IRE reduced local and distant tumor burden prolonging survival in a murine orthotopic PC model. This combination augmented immune cell infiltration to the PC tumor microenvironment and potentiated the trained response from tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. The antitumor effect of this dual therapy occurred independent of the adaptive immune response. Further, orally administered \u03b2-glucan was identified as an alternative route to induce trained immunity in the murine pancreas and prolonged PC survival in combination with IRE. \u03b2-Glucan in vitro treatment also induced trained immunity in peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with treatment-na\u00efve PC. Finally, orally administered \u03b2-glucan was found to significantly alter the innate cell landscape within the peripheral blood of five patients with stage III locally-advanced PC who had undergone IRE.\n\n**Conclusions** These data highlight a relevant and novel application of trained immunity within the setting of surgical ablation that may stand to benefit patients with PC.\n\n\n\n>WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC\n\n>- Recent evidence has demonstrated that inducing trained immunity by Bacillus-Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin and influenza vaccines, as well as natural compounds such as \u03b2-glucans, is capable of reducing tumor progression and controlling tumor metastasis. It is critical to understand how tumor cells elicit a trained response and whether the intensity or level of trained immunity is associated with therapeutic efficacy.\n\n>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\n\n>- We demonstrated that irreversible electroporation (IRE)-ablated tumor cells elicited a potent trained response and augmented antitumor innate immunity. In vivo, \u03b2-glucan in combination with IRE reduced local and distant tumor burden, prolonging survival in a murine orthotopic pancreatic cancer (PC) model. Orally administered \u03b2-glucan in patients with stage III PC who had undergone IRE also induced a trained immunity phenotype in peripheral monocytes.\n\n>HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\n\n>- Based on our findings, it is suggested that inducing trained immunity in patients with PC may elicit antitumor innate immunity and augment the current immunotherapeutic modalities, such as immune checkpoint blockade therapy.", "score": 1, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

The fast-twitch EDL muscle was harvested, and the muscle fibre-type composition, individual muscle cross-sectional area and myotube diameter were measured. We found an increase in the percentage of type IIa and IIx myosin heavy chain fibres in the whole EDL muscle, but a decrease in type IIB myosin heavy chain in both HFD protocols. The cross-sectional area and myofibre diameter were lower in both groups of aged mice (after 20 months of LFD or HFD) compared with young mice (after 4 months of the diets), but there were no differences between mice fed LFD or HFD for 20 months.

In the adult brain, NSCs are largely quiescent, suggesting that deregulation of quiescence maintenance may be a prerequisite for tumor initiation. Although inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is a frequent event in gliomagenesis, whether or how it affects quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) remains unclear. Here, we show that p53 maintains quiescence by inducing fatty-acid oxidation (FAO) and that acute p53 deletion in qNSCs results in their premature activation to a proliferative state. Mechanistically, this occurs through direct transcriptional induction of PPARGC1a, which in turn activates PPAR\u03b1 to upregulate FAO genes. Dietary supplementation with fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids, natural PPAR\u03b1 ligands, fully restores quiescence of p53-deficient NSCs and delays tumor initiation in a glioblastoma mouse model.

Here, we use empirical datasets from natural, degraded and restored peatlands in non-permafrost boreal and temperate regions to model net ecosystem exchange and methane fluxes, integrating peatland degradation status, wildfire combustion and post-fire dynamics. We find that wildfire processes reduced carbon uptake in pristine peatlands by 35% and further enhanced emissions from degraded peatlands by 10%. The current small net sink is vulnerable to the interactions of peatland degraded area, burn rate and peat burn severity. Climate change impacts accelerated carbon losses, where increased burn severity and burn rate reduced the carbon sink by 38% and 65%, respectively, by 2100.

Here we develop a new oxide-dispersion-strengthened NiCoCr-based alloy using a model-driven alloy design approach and laser-based additive manufacturing. This oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloy, called GRX-810, uses laser powder bed fusion to disperse nanoscale Y2O3 particles throughout the microstructure without the use of resource-intensive processing steps such as mechanical or in situ alloying. We show the successful incorporation and dispersion of nanoscale oxides throughout the GRX-810 build volume via high-resolution characterization of its microstructure. The mechanical results of GRX-810 show a twofold improvement in strength, over 1,000-fold better creep performance and twofold improvement in oxidation resistance compared with the traditional polycrystalline wrought Ni-based alloys used extensively in additive manufacturing at 1,093\u2009\u00b0C. The success of this alloy highlights how model-driven alloy designs can provide superior compositions using far fewer resources compared with the \u2018trial-and-error\u2019 methods of the past.

How these activities are coordinated to prevent hypoglycemia and hepatosteatosis is unclear. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) is rate controlling for gluconeogenesis. However, inborn human FBP1 deficiency does not cause hypoglycemia unless accompanied by fasting or starvation, which also trigger paradoxical hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia. Hepatocyte FBP1-ablated mice exhibit identical fasting-conditional pathologies along with AKT hyperactivation, whose inhibition reversed hepatomegaly, hepatosteatosis, and hyperlipidemia but not hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, fasting-mediated AKT hyperactivation is insulin dependent. Independently of its catalytic activity, FBP1 prevents insulin hyperresponsiveness by forming a stable complex with AKT, PP2A-C, and aldolase B (ALDOB), which specifically accelerates AKT dephosphorylation. Enhanced by fasting and weakened by elevated insulin, FBP1:PP2A-C:ALDOB:AKT complex formation, which is disrupted by human FBP1 deficiency mutations or a C-terminal FBP1 truncation, prevents insulin-triggered liver pathologies and maintains lipid and glucose homeostasis. Conversely, an FBP1-derived complex disrupting peptide reverses diet-induced insulin resistance.\n\nGraphical abstract:\n\nhttps://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1550413123001262-fx1\\_lrg.jpg", "score": 5, "author": "Homme-au-doigt", "page_title": "ScienceDirect"}]}

Hornets are also very successful as invasive species, with often devastating economic, ecological and societal effects. Understanding why these wasps are such successful invaders is critical to managing future introductions and minimising impact on native biodiversity. Critical to the management toolkit is a comprehensive genomic resource for these insects. Here we provide the annotated genomes for two hornets, Vespa crabro and Vespa velutina. We compare their genomes with those of other social Hymenoptera, including the northern giant hornet Vespa mandarinia. The three hornet genomes show evidence of selection pressure on genes associated with reproduction, which might facilitate the transition into invasive ranges. Vespa crabro has experienced positive selection on the highest number of genes, including those putatively associated with molecular binding and olfactory systems. Caste-specific brain transcriptomic analysis also revealed 133 differentially expressed genes, some of which are associated with olfactory functions. This report provides a spring-board for advancing our understanding of the evolution and ecology of hornets, and opens up opportunities for using molecular methods in the future management of both native and invasive populations of these over-looked insects.", "score": 1, "author": "FillsYourNiche", "page_title": "Putting hornets on the genomic map | Scientific Reports"}]}

A new [study](https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2023.1113952) in Frontiers in Sports and Active Living found that greater breast support during running is associated with increased knee joint stiffness, altering the lower body biomechanics of female runners. Specifically, a low support bra was associated with a 2% increase in knee joint stiffness, and a high support bra with 5%.\n\nRunning is one of the most accessible forms of exercise with an array of proven cardiovascular and musculoskeletal benefits, and an added bonus of increased mental health. Good quality running gear, such as the right pair of shoes, is vital to improve running performance and reduce injury risk. For women particularly, a well-designed sports bra protects from exercise-induced breast pain, which can be a significant barrier to practicing sports. Up to 72% of women experience breast pain while running.\n\nPrevious research has shown that the increased breast support sports bras offer not only influences breast movement but can also positively influence running performance. Greater breast support has been linked to lower oxygen consumption and better range of motion.\n\nDr Douglas Powell and Hailey Fong and colleagues at the Breast Biomechanics Research Center at the University of Memphis wanted to further investigate the effect of a good sports bra on running biomechanics.\n\n\u201cThe biomechanics underlying improved running performance with greater breast support are not well understood. Our study represents one of a series of research studies on the topic of breast support and whole body biomechanics,\u201d explained Powell. \u201cWe wanted to identify strategies to reduce activity-induced breast pain for females, a group that makes up approximately 50% of the population.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Powell and his colleagues looked at the influence of breast support on knee joint stiffness during treadmill running. Knee joint stiffness is a biomechanical measure that indicates how resistant the knee joint is to movement when force is applied. Knee joint stiffness has been associated with lower oxygen consumption, improved running performance, and running-related injury.\n\nA sample size of 12 recreational runners, aged between 18 and 35 years, with a self reported B-, C-, or D-cup were professionally fitted with two different sports bras: a high support bra and a low support bra. For the control condition, the participants were asked to perform the experiment bare chested. Each participant then performed three-minute running bouts in each of the three randomized breast support conditions (high, low, bare/control).\n\nTo collect the data the researchers used a 10-camera motion capture system and instrumented treadmill. The movements of the participants were tracked using individual retroreflective markers fitted on different parts of their bodies. The researchers used Visual3D to calculate knee joint excursions, while custom software was used to calculate knee joint stiffness and breast displacements during the stance phase of running in each experimental condition.", "score": 13, "author": "chrisdh79", "page_title": "Error: DOI Not Found"}, {"id": "jh5ssni", "body": "Really wish they'd described the high support bra in greater detail.

In **moderate certainty evidence,** cranberry products reduced the risk of UTIs (6211 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.84; I\u00b2 = 69%).\n\nExploring this last point a bit more:  \n1. Moderate certainty means that there is a moderate probability that future research would change their findings (ex: cranberry products don't actually help). Or, that there is \"moderate\" certainty that these findings are \"real.\"  \n2. The I2 of 69% is a fairly high degree of heterogeneity, which is somewhat addressed by their choice of random-effects methods. HOWEVER, this is getting into the realm of heterogeneity where you question whether it made sense at all to meta-analyze the results. \n\nA meta-analysis is fundamentally a hot-dog machine. If you put good things into it, you'll get a good hot dog. If you put in boots and a dead raccoon, you'll still get a hot dog, but you probably shouldn't eat it.\n\nA high I2 is one of the hints that this meta-analysis may be been made out of boots and a dead racoon.\n\nThe take away point is that these results are far from conclusive that cranberry products are useful to prevent UTIs.\n\nIf you are going to do this, be aware that not all cranberry juice products even contain the active ingredient in question, and that you may need to be drinking up to 1L a day, for at least 4 weeks straight, to receive any benefit.", "score": 7, "author": "aedes"}, {"id": "jh08k6h", "body": "I would take this review with a healthy grain of salt.

The effect of broad-spectrum antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis in reducing SSI is poorly understood.\r  \n\r  \nObjective  To define the effect of broad-spectrum perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis on postoperative SSI incidence compared with standard care antibiotics.\r  \n\r  \nDesign, Setting, and Participants  Pragmatic, open-label, multicenter, randomized phase 3 clinical trial at 26 hospitals across the US and Canada. Participants were enrolled between November 2017 and August 2021, with follow-up through December 2021. Adults undergoing open pancreatoduodenectomy for any indication were eligible. Individuals were excluded if they had allergies to study medications, active infections, chronic steroid use, significant kidney dysfunction, or were pregnant or breastfeeding. Participants were block randomized in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by the presence of a preoperative biliary stent. Participants, investigators, and statisticians analyzing trial data were unblinded to treatment assignment.\r  \n\r  \nIntervention  The intervention group received piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 or 4 g intravenously) as perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis, while the control group received cefoxitin (2 g intravenously; standard care).\r  \n\r  \nMain Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was development of postoperative SSI within 30 days. Secondary end points included 30-day mortality, development of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula, and sepsis. All data were collected as part of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program.\r  \n\r  \nResults  The trial was terminated at an interim analysis on the basis of a predefined stopping rule. Of 778 participants (378 in the piperacillin-tazobactam group \\[median age, 66.8 y; 233 {61.6%} men\\] and 400 in the cefoxitin group \\[median age, 68.0 y; 223 {55.8%} men\\]), the percentage with SSI at 30 days was lower in the perioperative piperacillin-tazobactam vs cefoxitin group (19.8% vs 32.8%; absolute difference, \u221213.0% \\[95% CI, \u221219.1% to \u22126.9%\\]; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

The effectiveness of metabolic activity in hepatocytes is determined by the quality and quantity of its mitochondria. Mitochondrial function is complex, and they act via various dynamic networks, which rapidly adapt to changes in the cellular milieu. Our present study aims to investigate the effects of low protein programming on the structure and function of mitochondria in the hepatocytes of adult females. Pregnant rats were fed with a control or isocaloric low-protein diet from gestational day 4 until delivery. A normal laboratory chow was given to all dams after delivery and to pups after weaning. The rats were euthanized at 4 months of age and the livers were collected from female offspring for investigating the mitochondrial structure, mtDNA copy number, mRNA, and proteins expression of genes associated with mitochondrial function. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and used for the analysis of the mitochondrial bioenergetics profiles. The mitochondrial ultrastructure showed that the in utero low-protein diet exposure led to increased mitochondrial fusion. Accordingly, there was an increase in the mRNA and protein levels of the mitochondrial fusion gene Opa1 and mitochondrial biogenesis genes Pgc1a and Essra, but Fis1, a fission gene, was downregulated. Low protein programming also impaired the mitochondrial function of the hepatocytes with a decrease in basal respiration ATP-linked respiration and proton leak. In summary, the present study suggests that the hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction induced by an in utero low protein diet might be a potential mechanism linking glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in adult offspring.", "score": 1, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

We report successful blood-brain barrier opening and focal delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 vectors into brain regions involved in Parkinson\u2019s disease using low-intensity focus ultrasound in adult macaque monkeys. Openings were well tolerated with generally no associated abnormal magnetic resonance imaging signals. Neuronal green fluorescent protein expression was observed specifically in regions with confirmed blood-brain barrier opening. Similar blood-brain barrier openings were safely demonstrated in three patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. In these patients and in one monkey, blood-brain barrier opening was followed by 18F-Choline uptake in the putamen and midbrain regions based on positron emission tomography. This indicates focal and cellular binding of molecules that otherwise would not enter the brain parenchyma. The less-invasive nature of this methodology could facilitate focal viral vector delivery for gene therapy and might allow early and repeated interventions to treat neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n----\n\nMedia summary tag line:\n\n> A study in monkeys and human patients shows how the blood-brain barrier can be crossed to allow the delivery of drugs that, in theory, could treat Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s\n\nSome excerpts from the media summary article:\n\n> This work has shown that the blood-brain barrier can be opened for a few precious hours to deliver the desired drugs to the brain. To achieve this, the researchers have used a very new technology: low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU).\n\n> This non-invasive treatment is performed on a machine similar to an MRI. The subject wears a helmet that emits inaudible soundwaves that manage to reach very specific areas of the brain, as the machine is guided by real-time brain images. Prior to this, lipid-shelled microbubbles are administered, and these are activated inside the blood vessel when they come into contact with the soundwaves, opening a crack a few millimeters wide in the BBB \u2014 which is big enough for the desired drug to slip through.\n\n> Researchers tested this technique on monkeys, and found that they can open the brain barrier for about 24 hours and introduce deactivated adenoviruses, which are commonly used for gene therapy, in which gene treatments are delivered directly to the target area. No apparent side effects were reported. The study, which was published in Science Advances, also reported that this same technology was also able to temporarily deactivate the BBB of three Parkinson\u2019s patients, in the exact part of their brain that was being targeted.\n\n---\n\n> Until now, experimental gene therapies had to be delivered to Parkinson\u2019s patients directly into the brain, which involved piercing the skull with needles to bypass the blood-brain barrier. The new LIFU technique opens up the possibility of delivering gene therapy without surgery or serious side effects.", "score": 10, "author": "MCPtz", "page_title": "Just a moment..."}]}

While humans undoubtedly possess both altruistic and selfish tendencies, it is crucial to recognize that these behaviors are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, the prevalence of cooperation and assistance observed across diverse cultures indicates that the innate drive to help others is a fundamental aspect of human nature.\r  \n\r  \nThe argument that certain selfish behaviors are essential for individual or societal success might be seen as an attempt to justify actions that prioritize personal gain over the collective good. Such claims could be interpreted as apologetics for sociopathic tendencies, which do not accurately reflect the complex balance of traits that make up human nature.\r  \n\r  \nEarly human development provides an excellent example of the innate drive for altruistic behavior. Babies and young children often exhibit a strong inclination to soothe, comfort, and share with others, highlighting the inherent cooperative tendencies that are present from an early age. While selfish behaviors, such as those observed in greedy toddlers, do emerge later in development, it is essential to recognize that both cooperative and self-interested traits coexist within individuals.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, the recent research on human cooperation adds valuable insights to the ongoing debate surrounding human nature and its balance of selfish and altruistic tendencies. The study's findings reinforce the idea that cooperation and assistance are deeply ingrained in human behavior across diverse cultures, providing a compelling counterpoint to the notion that selfishness is the primary driving force behind human actions.

A recent study suggests that up to one in 20 new diabetes cases could be linked to Covid-19.\r  \n\r  \nThe study, published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, analyzed data from more than 3 million individuals in the United States. The researchers found that people who had been infected with Covid-19 were more likely to develop diabetes within six months than those who had not been infected. The risk of developing diabetes was highest in people who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 and those with severe Covid-19 infections.\r  \n\r  \nThe study adds to a growing body of research suggesting a link between Covid-19 and diabetes. Other studies have found that people with diabetes are more likely to have severe Covid-19 infections and are at increased risk of dying from Covid-19.\r  \n\r  \nThe exact mechanisms underlying the link between Covid-19 and diabetes are not yet fully understood. It is possible that Covid-19 may cause inflammation and damage to the pancreas, the organ responsible for producing insulin. Additionally, the stress of a severe illness like Covid-19 may trigger the development of diabetes in people who are predisposed to the condition.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, these findings underscore the importance of diabetes prevention and management during the Covid-19 pandemic. People with diabetes should take extra precautions to avoid Covid-19 infection, while healthcare providers should be vigilant for signs of diabetes in people who have had Covid-19.\n\n**Follow or message us for more info**", "score": 1, "author": "helth_5792"}]}

Transcriptomic age (TA) predictors provide an opportunity to test the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on biological age utilizing whole-genome expression data. A single-site, single-blinded, randomized controlled clinical trial design was utilized. Thirty sedentary participants (aged 40\u201365) were assigned to either a HIIT group or a no-exercise control group. After collecting baseline measures, HIIT participants performed three 10\u2009\u00d7\u20091 HIIT sessions per week for 4\u2009weeks. Each session lasted 23\u2009min, and total exercise duration was 276\u2009min over the course of the 1-month exercise protocol. TA, PSS-10 score, PSQI score, PHQ-9 score, and various measures of body composition were all measured at baseline and again following the conclusion of exercise/control protocols. Transcriptomic age reduction of 3.59\u2009years was observed in the exercise group while a 3.29-years increase was observed in the control group. Also, PHQ-9, PSQI, BMI, body fat mass, and visceral fat measures were all improved in the exercise group. A hypothesis-generation gene expression analysis suggested exercise may modify autophagy, mTOR, AMPK, PI3K, neurotrophin signaling, insulin signaling, and other age-related pathways. A low dose of HIIT can reduce an mRNA-based measure of biological age in sedentary adults between the ages of 40 and 65\u2009years old. Other changes in gene expression were relatively modest, which may indicate a focal effect of exercise on age-related biological processes.", "score": 7, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Comparative analyses of microbiome features such as composition, abundance, and specificity, can shed light on bee ecology and the evolution of host\u2013microbe interactions. Here we study microbiomes of ground-nesting cellophane bees (Colletidae: Diphaglossinae). From a microbial point of view, the diphaglossine genus Ptiloglossa is particularly remarkable: their larval provisions are liquid and smell consistently of fermentation. We sampled larval provisions and various life stages from wild nests of Ptiloglossa arizonensis and two species of closely related genera: Caupolicana yarrowi and Crawfordapis luctuosa. We also sampled nectar collected by P. arizonensis. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we find that larval provisions of all three bee species are near-monocultures of lactobacilli. Nectar communities are more diverse, suggesting ecological filtering. Shotgun metagenomic and phylogenetic data indicate that Ptiloglossa culture multiple species and strains of Apilactobacillus, which circulate among bees and flowers. Larval lactobacilli disappear before pupation, and hence are likely not vertically transmitted, but rather reacquired from flowers as adults. Thus, brood cell microbiomes are qualitatively similar between diphaglossine bees and other solitary bees: lactobacilli-dominated, environmentally acquired, and non-species-specific. However, shotgun metagenomes provide evidence of a shift in bacterial abundance. As compared with several other bee species, Ptiloglossa have much higher ratios of bacterial to plant biomass in larval provisions, matching the unusually fermentative smell of their brood cells. Overall, Ptiloglossa illustrate a path by which hosts can evolve quantitatively novel symbioses: not by acquiring or domesticating novel symbionts, but by altering the microenvironment to favor growth of already widespread and generalist microbes.", "score": 3, "author": "Hrmbee", "page_title": "404 - Page not found"}, {"id": "jh781sr", "body": "Wow discovered something native Americans knew about 1000-500 years back.

Such underwater behaviour is difficult to observe but can play a critical role in the whales\u2019 survival and well-being. Distinguishing social behaviours from those which serve a specific function remains challenging due to a lack of direct observations and detailed descriptions of such behaviours. A CATS (Customized Animal Tracking Solutions) suction cup tag with on board video and a 3D inertial measurement unit was deployed on three different humpback whales to assess their behaviour in the Gold Coast bay, Australia. Here, we present evidence of humpback whales (tagged and untagged individuals) performing bottom contact with prolonged rolling on sandy substrate. In addition, we showed that fish were actively feeding from the whales\u2019 skin during this behaviour.

The new findings have been published in [Psychiatry Research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115133).\n\nKetamine therapy is a type of treatment for depression that involves the use of ketamine, an anesthetic drug that has been found to have antidepressant properties. The therapy typically involves a series of intravenous (IV) infusions of ketamine in a clinical setting, under the supervision of a trained healthcare provider.\n\nKetamine works differently than traditional antidepressant medications, which usually target serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. Instead, ketamine acts on a different neurotransmitter called glutamate, which is involved in communication between brain cells.\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with BPD often have difficulty regulating their emotions and experience intense mood swings, which can lead to impulsive behavior and strained relationships.\n\nBPD often coexists with major depressive disorder. When BPD and depression are present together, the depression tends to be more severe and resistant to treatment. Even with available treatments like antidepressants and psychotherapy, people with BPD often have poorer outcomes than those without BPD. Unfortunately, there is currently no FDA-approved treatment specifically for depressed individuals with comorbid BPD.\n\n\u201cThis analysis was directly inspired by my experience treating patients with depression with comorbid borderline personality,\u201d said study author Joshua D.

Dedifferentiation is a process by which a more differentiated cell reverts to a less differentiated state. In the case of McSCs, dedifferentiation allows them to self-renew and replenish their population.\n\n>The researchers found that McSCs undergo dedifferentiation in response to a number of factors, including stress, inflammation, and DNA damage. Dedifferentiation is initiated by a process called p63 signaling. p63 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation. When p63 signaling is activated, it causes McSCs to downregulate genes involved in differentiation and upregulate genes involved in self-renewal.\n\n>The researchers also found that dedifferentiation is essential for the maintenance of McSCs in the hair follicle. McSCs that are unable to undergo dedifferentiation eventually die. This suggests that dedifferentiation is a critical process for the long-term survival of McSCs.\n\n>The researchers are hopeful that this discovery could lead to new treatments for hair loss.

Associations were similar in the polygenic risk score analyses and were evident even in participants who had never been depressed themselves but had a family history of depression.\n\nMeaning  In this study, whether assessed by family history or genetic data, depression in prior generations was associated with lower cognitive performance in offspring, which has important implications for understanding and addressing potentially modifiable risk factors.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nImportance  Cognitive impairment in depression is poorly understood. Family history of depression is a potentially useful risk marker for cognitive impairment, facilitating early identification and targeted intervention in those at highest risk, even if they do not themselves have depression. Several research cohorts have emerged recently that enable findings to be compared according to varying depths of family history phenotyping, in some cases also with genetic data, across the life span.\n\nObjective  To investigate associations between familial risk of depression and cognitive performance in 4 independent cohorts with varied depth of assessment, using both family history and genetic risk measures.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants  This study used data from the Three Generations at High and Low Risk of Depression Followed Longitudinally (TGS) family study (data collected from 1982 to 2015) and 3 large population cohorts, including the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (data collected from 2016 to 2021), National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health; data collected from 1994 to 2018), and UK Biobank (data collected from 2006 to 2022). Children and adults with or without familial risk of depression were included. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted from March to June 2022.\n\nExposures  Family history (across 1 or 2 prior generations) and polygenic risk of depression.\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures  Neurocognitive tests at follow-up. Regression models were adjusted for confounders and corrected for multiple comparisons.\n\nResults  A total of 57\u202f308 participants were studied, including 87 from TGS (42 \\[48%\\] female; mean \\[SD\\] age, 19.7 \\[6.6\\] years), 10\u202f258 from ABCD (4899 \\[48%\\] female; mean \\[SD\\] age, 12.0 \\[0.7\\] years), 1064 from Add Health (584 \\[49%\\] female; mean \\[SD\\] age, 37.8 \\[1.9\\] years), and 45\u202f899 from UK Biobank (23\u202f605 \\[51%\\] female; mean \\[SD\\] age, 64.0 \\[7.7\\] years). In the younger cohorts (TGS, ABCD, and Add Health), family history of depression was primarily associated with lower performance in the memory domain, and there were indications that this may be partly associated with educational and socioeconomic factors. In the older UK Biobank cohort, there were associations with processing speed, attention, and executive function, with little evidence of education or socioeconomic influences. These associations were evident even in participants who had never been depressed themselves. Effect sizes between familial risk of depression and neurocognitive test performance were largest in TGS; the largest standardized mean differences in primary analyses were \u22120.55 (95% CI, \u22121.49 to 0.38) in TGS, \u22120.09 (95% CI, \u22120.15 to \u22120.03) in ABCD, \u22120.16 (95% CI, \u22120.31 to \u22120.01) in Add Health, and \u22120.10 (95% CI, \u22120.13 to \u22120.06) in UK Biobank. Results were generally similar in the polygenic risk score analyses. In UK Biobank, several tasks showed statistically significant associations in the polygenic risk score analysis that were not evident in the family history models.\n\nConclusions and Relevance  In this study, whether assessed by family history or genetic data, depression in prior generations was associated with lower cognitive performance in offspring. There are opportunities to generate hypotheses about how this arises through genetic and environmental determinants, moderators of brain development and brain aging, and potentially modifiable social and lifestyle factors across the life span.", "score": 6, "author": "-janusjanus-"}, {"id": "jgy7xrg", "body": "Ooh, let's see how fucked I am", "score": 2, "author": "xgamer444"}]}

Dietary interventions such as the ketogenic diet and hydroxycitric acid supplementation (a caloric restriction mimetic) may potentially protect neurons from mitochondrial damage induced by focal stroke in mice. We showed that in control mice, the ketogenic diet and the hydroxycitric acid did not impact significantly on the mtDNA integrity and expression of genes involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control in the brain, liver, and kidney. The ketogenic diet changed the bacterial composition of the gut microbiome, which via the gut-brain axis may affect the increase in anxiety behavior and reduce mice mobility. The hydroxycitric acid causes mortality and suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver. Focal stroke modelling caused a significant decrease in the mtDNA copy number in both ipsilateral and contralateral brain cortex and increased the levels of mtDNA damage in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These alterations were accompanied by a decrease in the expression of some of the genes involved in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. The ketogenic diet consumption before stroke protects mtDNA in the ipsilateral cortex, probably via activation of the Nrf2 signaling. The hydroxycitric acid, on the contrary, increased stroke-induced injury. Thus, the ketogenic diet is the most preferred variant of dietetic intervention for stroke protection compared with the hydroxycitric acid supplementation. Our data confirm some reports about hydroxycitric acid toxicity, not only for the liver but also for the brain under stroke condition.", "score": 3, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Chen et al. engineered an S. epidermidis strain to express melanoma tumor antigens and then tested their ability to drive antitumor immune responses (see the Perspective by Sajjath et al.). Engineered S. epidermidis generated tumor-specific T cells that infiltrated and reduced the growth of localized and metastatic melanoma.

A hallmark of this encounter is that adaptive immunity develops preemptively, in the absence of an infection. However, the functional properties of colonist-induced T cells are not well defined, limiting our ability to understand anticommensal immunity and harness it therapeutically. We addressed both challenges by engineering the skin bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis to express tumor antigens anchored to secreted or cell-surface proteins. Upon colonization, engineered S. epidermidis elicits tumor-specific T cells that circulate, infiltrate local and metastatic lesions, and exert cytotoxic activity. Thus, the immune response to a skin colonist can promote cellular immunity at a distal site and can be redirected against a target of therapeutic interest by expressing a target-derived antigen in a commensal.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Herein, we explored microglial epigenetic marks using the known inflammagen LPS as a memory priming trigger and Parkinsonian-linked environmental neurotoxic stressor manganese (Mn) as the secondary environmental trigger. To mimic physiological responses, the memory priming trigger LPS treatment was removed by triple-washing to allow the cells\u2019 acute inflammatory response to reset back before applying the secondary insult. Our results show that after the secondary Mn insult, levels of key proinflammatory markers, including nitrite release, iNOS mRNA and protein expression, Il-6, Il-\u03b1 and cytokines were exaggerated in LPS-primed microglia. Our paradigm implies primed microglia retain immune memory that can be reprogrammed to augment inflammatory response by secondary environmental stress. To ascertain the molecular underpinning of this neuroimmune memory, we further hypothesize that epigenetic reprogramming contributes to the retention of a heightened immune response. Interestingly, Mn-exposed, LPS-primed microglia showed enhanced deposition of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 along with H3K4me1. We further confirmed the results using a PD mouse model (MitoPark) and postmortem human PD brains, thereby adding clinical relevance to our findings. Co-treatment with the p300/H3K27ac inhibitor GNE-049 reduced p300 expression and H3K27ac deposition, decreased iNOS, and increased ARG1 and IRF4 levels. Lastly, since mitochondrial stress is a driver of environmentally linked Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) progression, we examined the effects of GNE-049 on primary trigger-induced mitochondrial stress. GNE-049 reduced mitochondrial superoxide, mitochondrial circularity and stress, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, suggesting beneficial consequences of GNE-049 on mitochondrial function. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that proinflammatory primary triggers can shape microglial memory via the epigenetic mark H3K27ac and that inhibiting H3K27ac deposition can prevent primary trigger immune memory formation and attenuate subsequent secondary inflammatory responses.", "score": 5, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Both smokers and healthy controls were excluded if they had any neurological or psychological disorders, drug abuse (except for nicotine), a prior head injury, anxiety disorders or major depression, or any contraindications for MRI scans. The severity of nicotine addiction was measured using a test called the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence.\n\nThe researchers used a mathematical model called the small-world model to compare the brain connectivity of the two groups.

Intracellular NAMPT (iNAMPT) is secreted and found in the blood as extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT). In the liver, the iNAMPT\u2212NAD+ axis oscillates in a circadian manner and regulates the cellular clockwork. Here we show that the hypothalamic NAD+ levels show a distinct circadian fluctuation with a nocturnal rise in lean mice. This rhythm is in phase with that of plasma eNAMPT levels but not with that of hypothalamic iNAMPT levels. Chemical and genetic blockade of eNAMPT profoundly inhibit the nighttime elevations in hypothalamic NAD+ levels as well as those in locomotor activity (LMA) and energy expenditure (EE). Conversely, elevation of plasma eNAMPT by NAMPT administration increases hypothalamic NAD+ levels and stimulates LMA and EE via the hypothalamic NAD+\u2212SIRT\u2212FOXO1\u2212melanocortin pathway. Notably, obese animals display a markedly blunted circadian oscillation in blood eNAMPT\u2212hypothalamic NAD+\u2212FOXO1 axis as well as LMA and EE.

Studies suggest that lactate modulates energy balance by lowering food intake, inducing adipose browning and increasing whole-body thermogenesis. Yet, like many other metabolites, lactate is often commercially produced as a counterion-bound salt and typically administered in vivo through hypertonic aqueous solutions of sodium l-lactate. Most studies have not controlled for injection osmolarity and the co-injected sodium ions. Here, we show that the anorectic and thermogenic effects of exogenous sodium l-lactate in male mice are confounded by the hypertonicity of the injected solutions. Our data reveal that this is in contrast to the antiobesity effect of orally administered disodium succinate, which is uncoupled from these confounders. Further, our studies with other counterions indicate that counterions can have confounding effects beyond lactate pharmacology. Together, these findings underscore the importance of controlling for osmotic load and counterions in metabolite research.", "score": 1, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here we profiled and analysed genome-wide, ageing-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematodes, fruitflies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (RNA polymerase II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed, we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin\u2013IGF signalling, both reversed most of these ageing-related changes. Genetic variants in RNA polymerase II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing the speed of RNA polymerase II by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal ageing and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventive measures.\u201d", "score": 5, "author": "BurrDurrMurrDurr"}, {"id": "jgsgb58", "body": "Indirect way to slow down shedding of telomeres?\n\nedit: then I see someone already made a similar comment, but gonna leave this here anyhow.", "score": 4, "author": "LooseyGreyDucky"}, {"id": "jgq93fa", "body": "Haven't read the article yet, is this because of telomeres?\n\nEdit: Read the article, same question on background assumption.", "score": -3, "author": "SylvPMDRTD"}]}

Indeed, every percentage point increase in successfully treated HIV saw a fivefold decrease in new infections, thus establishing treatment as prevention as a powerful public health strategy.\"\n\n   \nHere's a link to the published research if you'd like a read: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(23)00050-4/fulltext", "score": 159, "author": "unsw", "page_title": "Just a moment..."}, {"id": "jgl3vo1", "body": "**Summary**\n\nBackground\n\nAlthough HIV treatment-as-prevention reduces individual-level HIV transmission, population-level effects are unclear. We aimed to investigate whether treatment-as-prevention could achieve population-level reductions in HIV incidence among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM) in Australia's most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nMethods\n\nTAIPAN was a longitudinal cohort study using routine health record data extracted from 69 health services that provide HIV diagnosis and care to GBM in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia. Data from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2019, were linked within and between services and over time. TAIPAN collected data from all cisgender GBM who attended participating services, resided in New South Wales or Victoria, and were 16 years or older. Two cohorts were established: one included HIV-positive patients, and the other included HIV-negative patients. Population prevalence of viral suppression (plasma HIV viral load <200 RNA copies per \u03bcL) was calculated by combining direct measures of viral load among the HIV-positive cohort with estimates for undiagnosed GBM. The primary outcome of HIV incidence was measured directly via repeat testing in the HIV-negative cohort. Poisson regression analyses with generalised estimating equations assessed temporal associations between population prevalence of viral suppression and HIV incidence among the subsample of HIV-negative GBM with multiple instances of HIV testing.\n\nFindings\n\nAt baseline, the final sample (n=101\u2009772) included 90\u2009304 HIV-negative and 11\u2009468 HIV-positive GBM. 59\u2009234 patients in the HIV-negative cohort had two or more instances of HIV testing and were included in the primary analysis. Over the study period, population prevalence of viral suppression increased from 69\u00b727% (95% CI 66\u00b741\u201371\u00b796) to 88\u00b731% (86\u00b737\u201390\u00b735), while HIV incidence decreased from 0\u00b764 per 100 person-years (95% CI 0\u00b755\u20130\u00b776) to 0\u00b722 per 100 person-years (0\u00b717\u20130\u00b728). Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use, treatment-as-prevention achieved significant population-level reductions in HIV incidence among GBM: **a 1% increase in population prevalence of viral suppression corresponded with a 6% decrease in HIV incidence** (incidence rate ratio \\[IRR\\] 0\u00b794, 95% CI 0\u00b793\u20130\u00b796; p<0\u00b70001). PrEP was introduced in 2016 with 17\u00b760% uptake among GBM that year, which increased to 36\u00b738% in 2019. The relationship between population prevalence of viral suppression and HIV incidence was observed before the availability of PrEP (IRR 0\u00b798, 95% CI 0\u00b796\u20130\u00b799; p<0\u00b70001) and was even stronger after the introduction of PrEP (0\u00b780, 0\u00b770\u20130\u00b793; p=0\u00b70030).\n\nInterpretation\n\nOur results suggest that further investment in HIV treatment, especially alongside PrEP, can improve public health by reducing HIV incidence among GBM.", "score": 35, "author": "postraumata"}, {"id": "jgm5kru", "body": "[deleted]", "score": 43, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jglpue8", "body": "[removed]", "score": 21, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jgm0l25", "body": "Did u know effective treatment and healthcare helps people.", "score": 79, "author": "freezingkiss"}, {"id": "jglxq6a", "body": "Can someone explain ELI5 what the (n = 101 ,772) means?

(For those unaware, CD4 levels are a measure of a strong immune system). The logic was created at a time when AZT and other HIV treatments were the only option and the meds were so toxic they would eventually kill the patient.  Essentially, the strategy was to have infected people untreated with high levels of virus in their bodies and not begin treatment until they were nearing death.  Not only does this cause damage to the body and mind of a person, but also collectively creates a huge viral reservoir within the community.\n\nBut new drugs came along that were highly effective with minor side effects.  Rather than updating the guidance for treatment, our government neglected the gay community.

Normally, activations in brain regions underlying reward processing are elevated when a person is anticipating social rewards. The study was published in [Translational Psychiatry](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-023-02364-y).\n\nApproximately half of all adults in Europe and North America report having adverse experiences in their childhood. Studies have shown that adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse and neglect increase the risk of developing various mental health disorders in adulthood. These include, among others, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and somatic symptoms disorder.\n\nOne potential explanation for the link between adverse childhood experiences and psychopathology in adulthood is that adverse childhood experiences make changes to brain reward anticipation i.e., in how brain anticipates and represents future incentives. Early experiences with primary caregivers, particularly with mothers, shape reward anticipation throughout life.\n\nDue to this, maternal warmth and encouragement in childhood and adolescence is integral for developing healthy reward processing. However, maternal antipathy, a relationship in which the mother is cold and hostile towards the child is a common type of adverse childhood experience. It may contribute to potentially debilitating aberrations in reward processing later in life.\n\nStudy author Katja I. Seitz and her colleagues wanted to investigate the association between adverse childhood experiences and neural correlates of monetary and social reward anticipation. They were particularly interested in maternal antipathy.\n\nParticipants were 118 individuals with varying levels of adverse childhood experiences. Of these, 86 suffered from a psychiatric disorder (depression, posttraumatic stress syndrome or the somatic symptom disorder), while 32 were healthy volunteers. The somatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when a person has a significant focus on physical symptoms, such as pain, weakness or shortness of breath, to a level that results in major distress and problems in everyday functioning.", "score": 103, "author": "chrisdh79", "page_title": "Error: DOI Not Found"}, {"id": "jgmytuo", "body": "Jeez humanity is f\u2019d, if maternal antipathy is common resulting in just 27% of normal healthy people.", "score": 40, "author": "Minimum_Piglet_1457"}, {"id": "jgn44i8", "body": "[removed]", "score": 31, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jgopagv", "body": "Oh so that's why I am the way I am.", "score": 10, "author": "CaptainPajamaShark"}, {"id": "jgnmtox", "body": "I wonder how this maps to communities that don't have a monogamous nuclear family.

The objective of this study is to investigate the cardioprotective potential of empagliflozin and ketone bodies during acute myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n**Methods:**\n\nWe used a nondiabetic porcine model of ischemia reperfusion using a percutaneous occlusion of proximal left anterior descending artery for 45 minutes. Animals received 1-week pretreatment with either empagliflozin or placebo prior to MI induction. Additionally, a third group received intravenous infusion of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate BOHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate) during the MI induction. Acute effects of the treatments were assessed 4-hour post-MI by cardiac magnetic resonance and histology (thioflavin for area at risk, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining for MI size). All animals were euthanized immediately postcardiac magnetic resonance, and heart samples were collected.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe area at risk was similar in all groups. Empagliflozin treatment increased BOHB levels. Empagliflozin-treated animals showed significantly higher myocardial salvage, smaller MI size (both by cardiac magnetic resonance and histology), less microvascular obstruction, and improved cardiac function (left ventricle ejection fraction and strain). Furthermore, empagliflozin-treated animals demonstrated reduced biomarkers of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress compared with placebo. The BOHB group showed similar results to the empagliflozin group.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nOne-week pretreatment with empagliflozin ameliorates ischemia reperfusion injury, reduces MI size and microvascular obstruction, increases myocardial salvage, preserves left ventricle systolic function, and lowers apoptosis and oxidative stress. Periprocedural intravenous infusion of BOHB during myocardial ischemia also induces cardioprotection, suggesting a role for BOHB availability as an additional mechanism within the wide spectrum of actions of SGLT2i.", "score": 1, "author": "basmwklz"}, {"id": "jgpgit4", "body": "You need someone else to help you write.

The results suggest that low energy may be a basic human response to a lack of social contact. The study conducted at the University of Vienna and published in Psychological Science also showed that this response was affected by social personality traits of the participants. \n\nIf we do not eat for an extended period, a series of biological processes ensue that create a craving sensation we recognize as hunger. As a social species, we also need other people to survive. Evidence shows that a lack of social contact induces a craving response in our brains comparable to hunger, which motivates us to reconnect. The related \"social homeostasis\" hypothesis suggests that there is a dedicated homeostatic system that autonomously regulates our need for social contact. However, we know very little about the psychological responses to social isolation. Moreover, we do not know how these findings translate to the social isolation we experience in our daily lives, including the unique context of the COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nA group of scientists led by Giorgia Silani from the University of Vienna investigated the effects of social isolation using comparable methodology across two contexts: in the laboratory and at home during COVID-19 lockdown. For the study, 30 female volunteers came into the lab on three separate days, spending eight hours without social contact or without food or with both social contact and food. Multiple times throughout the day, they indicated their stress, mood, and fatigue, while physiological stress responses, such as heart rate and cortisol, were recorded by the scientists. In order to validate the results of the laboratory study, the results were compared with measurements from a study conducted during the lockdown in Austria and Italy in spring 2020. From this study, they used data from 87 participants who had spent at least an eight-hour period in isolation and whose stress and behavioural effects were assessed with the same measurements several times a day for seven days.\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09567976231156413", "score": 64, "author": "Wagamaga", "page_title": "Just a moment..."}, {"id": "jgh6541", "body": "[removed]", "score": 26, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jghzn69", "body": "That would be nice, but I just feel an emptiness.

Additional research is needed to determine the potential reasons for this association.\n\nDepression pre-diagnosis only and depression post-diagnosis only (but not persistent depression) were linked with worse survival compared with no depression. Specifically, depression pre-diagnosis was associated with a 26% higher risk of death, and depression post-diagnosis was associated with a 50% higher risk. Also, patients who did not receive guideline-recommended treatment faced a 118% higher risk of death than those who received recommended care.\n\nCompared with patients residing in non-Appalachian Kentucky, patients residing in Appalachia were 18% less likely to received recommended care, but investigators did not find any significant differences in survival.\n\nThe findings suggest that diagnosing and treating depression at the time of breast cancer diagnosis and beyond can be critical to patient care and survival.", "score": 1, "author": "chrisdh79", "page_title": "Error: DOI Not Found"}, {"id": "jgokbwx", "body": "Seems like that would be logical for any cancer.

However, the precise role of endogenous ketogenesis in mammalian life span, and the safety and efficacy of the long-term exogenous supplementation of ketone bodies remain unclear. In the present study, we show that a deficiency in endogenous ketogenesis, induced by whole-body Hmgcs2 deletion, shortens life span in mice, and that this is prevented by daily ketone body supplementation using a diet containing 1,3-butanediol, a precursor of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. Furthermore, feeding the 1,3-butanediol-containing diet from early in life increases midlife mortality in normal mice, but in aged mice it extends life span and prevents the high mortality associated with atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice. By contrast, an ad libitum low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet markedly increases mortality. In conclusion, endogenous ketogenesis affects mammalian survival, and ketone body supplementation may represent a double-edged sword with respect to survival, depending on the method of administration and health status.", "score": 13, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

This is due in part to a lack of observational constraints related to conditions in the primary acceleration region itself. Accelerated electrons with energies above \u223c20 keV are revealed by hard X-ray (HXR) bremsstrahlung emission, while accelerated electrons with even higher energies manifest themselves through radio gyrosynchrotron emission. \n\nHere, we show, for a well-observed flare on 2017 September 10, that a combination of RHESSI HXR and and the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) EUV observations provides a robust estimate of the fraction of the ambient electron population that is accelerated at a given time, with an upper limit of \u227210\u22122 on the number density of nonthermal (\u226520 keV) electrons, expressed as a fraction of the number density of ambient protons in the same volume. This upper limit is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than previously inferred from microwave observations of the same event. \n\nOur results strongly indicate that the fraction of accelerated electrons in the coronal region at any given time is relatively small but also that the overall duration of the HXR emission requires a steady resupply of electrons to the acceleration site.

This Ca2+ channel is activated by cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, but the mechanisms of Ca2+ activation are under debate. An \u201cocclusion model\u201d argues that Ca2+ binding to an MICU1 subunit releases MICU1 occlusion of the Ca2+ pathway to open the uniporter. However, a \u201cpotentiation model\u201d proposes that MICU1 does not block but enhances uniporter function. This study provides evidence to support MICU1 occlusion and offers alternative interpretations for the observations underlying the potentiation model. These results bring the field closer to a unifying molecular understanding of the interplay between the uniporter and intracellular Ca2+ signaling.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nThe mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a Ca2+ channel that imports cytoplasmic Ca2+ into the mitochondrial matrix to regulate cell bioenergetics, intracellular Ca2+ signaling, and apoptosis. The uniporter contains the pore-forming MCU subunit, an auxiliary EMRE protein, and the regulatory MICU1/MICU2 subunits. Structural and biochemical studies have suggested that MICU1 gates MCU by blocking/unblocking the pore. However, mitoplast patch-clamp experiments argue that MICU1 does not block, but instead potentiates MCU via allosteric mechanisms. Here, we address this direct clash of the proposed MICU1 function. Supporting the MICU1-occlusion mechanism, patch-clamp demonstrates that purified MICU1 strongly suppresses MCU Ca2+ currents, and this inhibition is abolished by mutating the MCU-interacting K126 residue. Moreover, a membrane-depolarization assay shows that MICU1 prevents MCU-mediated Na+ flux into intact mitochondria under Ca2+-free conditions. Examining the observations underlying the potentiation model, we found that MICU1 occlusion was not detected in mitoplasts not because MICU1 cannot block, but because MICU1 dissociates from the uniporter complex. Furthermore, MICU1 depletion reduces uniporter transport not because MICU1 can potentiate MCU, but because EMRE is down-regulated. These results firmly establish the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiologically crucial process of uniporter regulation by MICU1.", "score": 0, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

I've seen so many students sort of phase out of attention and follow the rules, 9nky to find that it really does all go out the window at the bedside.  I've also seen far too many nurses putting pressure on the students beyond their ability in the cognitive stage of learning to be comfortable...

That all said, I think the fundamental training in VR should precede all of the hands on (I'm assuming there's no way around the progress of the tech to become ubiquitous).

Emerging evidence indicates that endogenous and dietary-induced changes in fatty acid metabolism have a major impact on both T cell fate and autoimmunity. To date, however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the impact of fatty acid metabolism on T cell physiology and autoimmunity remain poorly understood. Here, we report that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), an enzyme essential for the desaturation of fatty acids and highly regulated by dietary factors, acts as an endogenous brake on regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and augments autoimmunity in an animal model of MS in a T cell-dependent manner. Guided by RNA sequencing and lipidomics analysis, we found that the absence of Scd1 in T cells promotes the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine through adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). ATGL-dependent release of docosahexaenoic acid enhanced Treg differentiation by activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Our findings identify fatty acid desaturation by SCD1 as an essential determinant of Treg differentiation and autoimmunity, with potentially broad implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and dietary interventions for autoimmune disorders such as MS.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here we profiled and analysed genome-wide, ageing-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematodes, fruitflies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (RNA polymerase II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed, we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin\u2013IGF signalling, both reversed most of these ageing-related changes. Genetic variants in RNA polymerase II that reduced its speed in worms5 and flies6 increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing the speed of RNA polymerase II by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal ageing and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventive measures.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Viability can be rescued by RNAi of hphd-1, which encodes the enzyme that produces D-2HG or by supplementing either vitamin B12 or the ketone bodies 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and acetoacetate (AA).

These pathological aggregates propagate into larger brain regions as the disease progresses, with the associated clinical symptoms becoming increasingly severe and complex. However, the factors that induce \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and spreading of the aggregates remain elusive. Herein, we have evaluated the effects of the major lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) on \u03b1-synuclein oligomerization and cell-to-cell transmission of this protein. Results: Incubation with HNE promoted the oligomerization of recombinant human \u03b1-synuclein via adduct formation at the lysine and histidine residues. HNE-induced \u03b1-synuclein oligomers evidence a little \u03b2-sheet structure and are distinct from amyloid fibrils at both conformation and ultrastructure levels. Nevertheless, the HNE-induced oligomers are capable of seeding the amyloidogenesis of monomeric \u03b1-synuclein under in vitro conditions. When neuronal cells were treated with HNE, both the translocation of \u03b1-synuclein into vesicles and the release of this protein from cells were increased. Neuronal cells can internalize HNE-modified \u03b1-synuclein oligomers, and HNE treatment increased the cell-to-cell transfer of \u03b1-synuclein proteins. Innovation and Conclusion: These results indicate that HNE induces the oligomerization of \u03b1-synuclein through covalent modification and promotes the cell-to-cell transfer of seeding-capable oligomers, thereby contributing to both the initiation and spread of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates.

Economically grounded in animal husbandry and dairying, the Xiongnu were famously nomadic, building their empire on the backs of horses. Their proficiency at mounted warfare made them swift and formidable foes, and their legendary conflicts with Imperial China ultimately led to the construction of the Great Wall.\n\nHowever, unlike their neighbors, the Xiongnu never developed a writing system, and consequently historical records about the Xiongnu have been almost entirely written and passed down by their rivals and enemies. Such accounts, largely recorded by Han Dynasty chroniclers, provide little useful information on the origins of the Xiongnu, their political rise, or their social organization. Although recent archaeogenetics studies have now traced the origins of the Xiongnu as a political entity to a sudden migration and mixing of disparate nomadic groups in northern Mongolia ca. 200 BCE, such findings have raised more questions than answers.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf3904", "score": 12, "author": "Wagamaga", "page_title": "Just a moment..."}, {"id": "jgczjij", "body": "It is misleading to use Mongolia's first nomadic empire in the title.

First of all, they didn't ask people who called themselves \"completely deaf\" any questions about hearing aid use. That's a huge oversight and very frustrating to me. Many people with severe to profound hearing loss refer to themselves as completely deaf, but use hearing aids. This study just assumed they all don't use hearing aids. Data skewed right off the bat.\n\nAnother huge weak point is that they only asked about hearing aid usage at baseline. Meaning people over that 12 year span, could have started using hearing aids, but they wouldn't have been recorded as doing so. \n\nHere's my issue with these studies that are always released/touted by the industry: if my hearing loss is so bad that I can barely participate in group conversations, but I wear hearing aids, what does that mean? \n\nThey talk about \"treated hearing loss\" - there is no such thing. It is only an aid, once you get past mild hearing loss, into moderate and severe and profound, hearing aids leave tons of gaps.\n\nWhy didn't they do proper follow up on hearing aid use status, and secondly, ask everyone, regardless of whether they call themselves completely deaf, about hearing aid usage? Why didn't they use actual hearing loss measurements? Accepted categories such as mild, moderate, severe, profound? \n\nThen there's the thought process: \n\n\"Possible mechanisms underlying the relationship of hearing loss with dementia include the reallocation of cognitive resources to auditory perceptual processing\" how does that contribute to dementia? If anything you are exercising your brain more. \n\n\"...cognitive deterioration due to long-term deprivation of auditory input\" where is the evidence that deprivation of auditory input causes dementia? People with hearing loss are largely not deprived of auditory input anyway, speech just becomes unclear, certain frequencies disappear, sounds need to be amplified, etc. Only the profoundly deaf experience no sound at all and could actually be able to be said to be \"deprived\"\n\n\"...a common neurodegenerative process in the ageing brain that drives both cognitive decline and hearing loss\"...ok, so something could be happening that is unrelated to hearing loss on its own.\n\n\"...Also, hearing loss manifested as central auditory dysfunction is generally viewed as an early marker of dementia.\" This is huge because this is not treated with hearing aids. They would have been lumped into the category of not using hearing aids and since this disorder is an early marker of dementia, will have further skewed the results.\n\n\"Hearing aids might delay cognitive decline by preventing auditory deprivation.\" Again, where's the evidence that \"auditory deprivation\" causes dementia? The brain adapts and finds ways around. \n\n\"First, individuals with hearing loss might require increased cognitive resources for auditory perceptual processing as they perform effortful listening\u2014ie, have high cognitive load.\" Still not seeing how that causes dementia. \n\n\"Hearing aids might reduce the cognitive load from listening, redirecting cognitive resources back to cognitive tasks.\" Yes it is very hard work trying to hear speech - even with hearing aids. Makes this study a moot point. \n\n\"Second, sensory deprivation caused by hearing loss might lead to structural alterations, including reduced volumes in the primary auditory cortex, whole brain, and right temporal lobe.\" Where's the evidence for this? They don't account for regions of the brain that might be used more to compensate for the lack of audio, such as the visual cortex. \n\nThey really should have done a better job of ascertaining hearing levels and hearing aid usage. The complete exclusion of people who call themselves deaf from the group that wears hearing aids renders this study almost useless.\n\nThe scientific community knows that social isolation, loneliness and depression can cause dementia, and they mention that in this article as well. I'm not sure why this is not mentioned, because it is so obvious to me, but the real cause here is likely access to *communication* and not *auditory input*. Lack of access to communication is present in the social factors such as isolation/loneliness as well as hearing loss. You need to work your brain with communication. When you start avoiding communication then I can easily see how things would go downhill. \n\nThe issue I have with these studies is that they act as if hearing aids are the thing that is just magic bullet that will fix the issue, when in reality, hearing aids don't help all that much with communication past a certain point of hearing loss. \n\nThese studies are always funded by vested interests in the hearing aid industry.

The study was published in the [Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy](https://doi.org/10.1080/0092623X.2023.2166637).\n\nSexual satisfaction refers to one\u2019s satisfaction with the sexual aspects of his or her intimate relationship. It is related to overall relationship satisfaction. This is particularly the case in committed relationships such as marriages. Sexual satisfaction helps build a strong bond between partners, reduce conflicts and increase intimacy. Sexual satisfaction was found to be linked with subjective well-being and life satisfaction.\n\nHowever, it is also associated with mental health factors, particularly depression, anxiety and stress. Particularly in middle-aged and older couples, one\u2019s depression was found to be linked to reduced sexual satisfaction of the partner. Studies have reported that people with low sexual satisfaction tend to more often have anxiety disorder.\n\nOther studies have linked general anxiety symptoms with low sexual satisfaction in non-clinical populations. Additionally, high levels of daily stress were found to be linked to lower sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.\n\nStudy author Selin Karkose and her colleagues wanted to examine the associations between depression, anxiety, stress and sexual satisfaction in married couples. They were also interested in examining whether one\u2019s sexual satisfaction is associated with one\u2019s partner\u2019s depression, anxiety and stress.\n\nStudy participants were 102 heterosexual married couples from Turkey.  Age of wives ranged between 21 and 45 years (29 on average). Husbands were between 23 and 50 years old, with an average of 31 years. The average age of marriage was 27 for wives and 29 for husbands.

Hydrogen is used to 1) de-sulpherize oil, 2) make ammonia, 3) make methanol, 4) reduction of iron ore to iron metal.\nHydrogen, therefore, is **used as a chemical**.

If all 550 planes leaving the airport were converted to hydrogen, the entire water consumption of Frankfurt (650 000 inhabitants) and the output of **25 full-size power plants would be needed to meet the hydrogen demand of air planes leaving just one airport in Germany.**\n\nThe energy demands of electrolysis-derived hydrogen are enormous.\n\nTo avoid wasting energy, just hook your PV system up to the grid and avoid the tax of the molecular-middle-man.", "score": 4, "author": "ChaoticLlama", "page_title": "The resource cannot be found."}, {"id": "jg7xjm0", "body": "So what's the catch with this revolutionary tech?...", "score": 2, "author": "kfpswf"}, {"id": "jg7z2ys", "body": "Seriously? \n\n\"A solar-to-hydrogen device-level efficiency of greater than 20% at an H2 production rate of >2.0\u2009kW (>0.8\u2009g\u2009min\u22121) is achieved.\"\n\nA complex, large, and expensive system which produces enough H2 to heat a kettle when the sun is out.", "score": -7, "author": "mingy"}, {"id": "jg8413p", "body": "Hydrogen fuel cells are the future.   \n\nBatteries in cars are just stupid.", "score": -11, "author": "Georgep0rwell"}, {"id": "jg8b9b0", "body": "Isn't this the \"chain reaction\" plot?", "score": 1, "author": "cobarso"}, {"id": "jg9a3r5", "body": "Seems the kind of technology that could change the world if scaled up", "score": 1, "author": "dbernard456"}, {"id": "jg9knt6", "body": "I feel like we are so close to finding the holly grail of energy", "score": 1, "author": "Sea-Specialist-4852"}, {"id": "jg9otzo", "body": "my god its ***THE*** breakthrough of the ~~century decade year month week day~~  hour!", "score": 1, "author": "mtsai"}, {"id": "jgbwpfi", "body": "I really wonder what would happen if you used solar energy to heat water and leaves/grass clippings/waste carbon to high heat at high pressure.

Research from other domains indicates that believing that one's willpower is nonlimited facilitates adhering to one's intentions, especially in the context of high demands. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of these lay beliefs about willpower and daily demands in the environmental context. The hypotheses were (1) that a nonlimited willpower belief would be related to more engagement in day-to-day pro-environmental behavior and (2) that this effect would be stronger on days with high demands. Participants (N\u202f=\u202f387) of an online daily dairy study reported their lay beliefs about willpower and their daily demands and pro-environmental behavior over three days. Results confirmed that a nonlimited willpower belief was related to more pro-environmental behavior, mainly because it facilitated sustained pro-environmental behavior on more demanding days. Additionally, we found that people who faced more demands across the entire study period engaged in less pro-environmental behavior irrespective of their willpower belief. These results indicate the relevance of demands and willpower beliefs in pro-environmental behavior. Future studies should examine their causal relationship and might inform future interventions to promote pro-environmental behavior (e.g., suggesting targeting people's demands and their willpower beliefs).", "score": 5, "author": "fordgrantorino"}]}

When tested a week after exposure, both those who eat meat and those who do not showed signs of shifting toward a mind-denying bias (Experiments 2, 3, and 6). These biases had important consequences for beliefs about animal minds. Inducing mind-denying memory biases caused participants to see animals as possessing less sophisticated minds (Experiments 7\u20139).

Five experiments supported this two-step model (USA and Norway; N = 3213; 10,433 judgments), showing that intuitive predictions are more optimistic than reflective predictions. Participants were randomly assigned to rely on fast intuition under time-pressure or slow reflection after time-delay. In Experiment 1, participants in both conditions thought positive events were more likely to happen to them than to other people and that negative events were less likely, replicating the classic finding of \u201cunrealistic optimism\u201d. Crucially, this optimistic tendency was significantly stronger in the intuitive condition. Participants in the intuitive condition also relied more on heuristic problem-solving (CRT). Experiments 2\u20133 found that participants in the intuitive condition thought they were at lower health risk than participants in the reflective condition. Experiment 4 provided a direct replication, with the additional finding that intuitive predictions were more optimistic only for oneself (and not about the average person). Experiment 5 failed to identify any intuitive difference in perceived reasons for success versus failure, but observed intuitive optimism in binary prediction of a future exercise habit.

The GL theory addresses one of the prime superconducting properties, screening of the electromagnetic field because it becomes massive within a superconductor, the famous Anderson\u2013Higgs mechanism. Here the authors describe another widely-spread type of superconductivity where the Anderson\u2013Higgs mechanism does not work and must be replaced by the Deser\u2013Jackiw\u2013Templeton topological mass generation and, correspondingly, the GL effective field theory must be replaced by an effective topological gauge theory. These superconductors are inherently inhomogeneous granular superconductors, where electronic granularity is either fundamental or emerging. It is shown that the corresponding superconducting transition is a 3D generalization of the 2D Berezinskii\u2013Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless vortex binding\u2013unbinding transition. The binding\u2013unbinding of the line-like vortices in 3D results in the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman scaling of the resistance near the superconducting transition.

A woman is also deemed less credible when she does not assertively confront the harassment in the moment and when she does not report it to her organization. Further, she is deemed less credible when there are no witnesses and when her alleged harasser has not been publicly accused of harassment by others. Her credibility is not affected by a power disparity with the harasser, the presence of alcohol, or a prior romantic relationship with the harasser.

High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity also results in bone loss, which is associated with an imbalanced gut microbiome. However, whether HFD-induced obesity or HFD itself promotes osteoclastogenesis and consequent bone loss remains unclear. In this study, we developed HFD-induced obesity (HIO) and non-obesity (NO) mouse models to evaluate the effect of HFD on bone loss. NO mice were defined as body weight within 5% of higher or lower than that of chow diet fed mice after 10 weeks HFD feeding. NO was protected from HIO-induced bone loss by the RANKL /OPG system, with associated increases in the tibia tenacity, cortical bone mean density, bone volume of cancellous bone, and trabecular number. This led to increased bone strength and improved bone microstructure via the microbiome-short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulation. Additionally, endogenous gut-SCFAs produced by the NO mice activated free fatty acid receptor 2 and inhibited histone deacetylases, resulting in the promotion of Treg cell proliferation in the HFD-fed NO mice; thereby, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis, which can be transplanted by fecal microbiome. Furthermore, T cells from NO mice retain differentiation of osteoclast precursors of RAW 264.7 macrophages ex vivo. Our data reveal that HFD is not a deleterious diet; however, the induction of obesity serves as a key trigger of bone loss that can be blocked by a NO mouse-specific gut microbiome.", "score": 2, "author": "basmwklz"}, {"id": "jg8x2ri", "body": "Can somebody explain the big cd....combo?

Fifty-six studies involving a total of 11,549 samples were included in the final analysis. Four reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in eligible studies. Pearson's r was chosen as the effect size metric of risk and protective factors.\r  \n\r  \nResults\r  \nThe results showed that the global prevalence of depression self-stigma was 29\u202f%. Levels of self-stigma varied across regions, but this difference was not significant. Two demographic factors were identified: ethnicity (r\u202f=\u202f0.10, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and having a partner/married (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.22, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Five risk factors were identified: depression severity (r\u202f=\u202f0.33, p\u202f<\u202f0.01), public stigma (r\u202f=\u202f0.44, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), treatment stigma (r\u202f=\u202f0.46, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), perceived stigma (r\u202f=\u202f0.37, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), and enacted stigma (r\u202f=\u202f0.71, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).

These studies have primarily been conducted in adult samples, despite adolescents being a particularly vulnerable group with regards to both being trolled and trolling others. In this study we aimed to (1) explore Australian adolescents\u2019 experiences of trolling, and (2) replicate adult research that has constructed a psychological profile of the Internet troll by examining the utility of personality traits (psychopathy and sadism), self-esteem, empathy (cognitive and affective), and social rewards (negative social potency) to predict adolescents\u2019 trolling behaviours. A sample of 157 Australian adolescents (40.8% male, 58% female, 0.6% non-binary) aged 13\u201318 years (M = 15.58, SD = 1.71) completed the Global Assessment of Internet Trolling-Revised, Adolescent Measure of Empathy and Sympathy, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Youth Psychopathy Traits Inventory-Short Version, Social Rewards Questionnaire, Short Sadistic Impulse Scale, and a series of questions related to the experience of trolling. Results showed in the past year, 24.2% of Australian adolescents reported being trolled and 13.4% reported having trolled others. Gender, psychopathy, sadism, self-esteem, cognitive empathy, affective empathy, and \u201cnegative social potency\u201d (i.e., enjoyment of antisocial rewards) combined, explained 30.7% of variance in adolescents\u2019 trolling behaviours (p < .001). When accounting for shared variance, gender (male), high psychopathy, and high negative social potency were significant predictors of trolling, aligning with findings of adult samples. Contrary to adult samples, sadism was not a unique predictor of adolescents\u2019 trolling. For adolescents, the variance in trolling explained by sadism was nonsignificant when controlling for negative social potency.

Metabolic dysfunction is common in patients with cancer and is associated with higher cancer recurrence rates and reduced overall survival. Yet, insulin resistance is rarely considered in the clinic and thus it is uncertain how frequently this condition occurs in patients with cancer.\n\nMethods\n\nTo address this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis guided by the Preferred Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We included studies assessing insulin resistance in patients with various cancer diagnoses, using the gold-standard hyperinsulinemic\u2013euglycemic clamp method. Studies eligible for inclusion were as follows: (1) included cancer patients older than 18 years of age; (2) included an age-matched control group consisting of individuals without cancer or other types of neoplasms; (3) measured insulin sensitivity using the hyperinsulinemic\u2013euglycemic clamp method. We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published from database inception through March 2023 with no language restriction, supplemented by backward and forward citation searching. Bias was assessed using funnel plot.\n\nFindings\n\nFifteen studies satisfied the criteria. The mean insulin-stimulated rate of glucose disposal (Rd) was 7.5\u2009mg/kg/min in control subjects (n\u2009=\u2009154), and 4.7\u2009mg/kg/min in patients with a cancer diagnosis (n\u2009=\u2009187).

This study aimed to produce a contemporary, comprehensive estimate of the correlates and harms from others\u2019 drinking in 2021 in Australia.\n\n**Design, setting, participants, measurements**\n\nAcross Australia, 2,574 adults (1,380 women; 1,172 men) were sampled via two cross-sectional survey modes: a random digit dial mobile phone sample of 1,000 people and 1,574 people from the Life in Australia\u2122 panel survey. Participants in 2021 were asked about harms they had experienced from the drinking of family, friends, co-workers and the public in the past year. Applying combined sample weights from each mode, bivariable and adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were used to analyse differences in rates of AHTO by participant gender, age, residence in rural or metropolitan regions, country of birth, education and employment.\n\n**Findings**\n\nIn 2021, 23.6% reported being negatively affected by strangers\u2019 drinking and 21.3% by the drinking of someone they knew, with 34.3% reporting being negatively affected a lot or a little by either. 42.4% of respondents reported specific harms from strangers\u2019 drinking. Thus, 48.1% of respondents reported any harm (negative effects or specific harms) from others\u2019 drinking. Women, younger people, Australian-born and heavier episodic drinkers reported significantly higher rates of AHTO compared with other respondents. Smaller percentages (7.5%) of participants reported being harmed substantially by others\u2019 drinking, including by people they knew (5.8%) or strangers (2.3%). Stratified analyses showed that heavier drinking, furloughed, younger, men who were born overseas in English-speaking countries were affected by others\u2019 drinking, whereas women were affected regardless of these factors (apart from age).\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nOver one-third of Australian adults appear to have been negatively affected by others\u2019 drinking in 2021, with women, younger people and heavier drinkers at more risk. Substantial harm appears to be more likely to arise from the drinking of people Australians know than from strangers\u2019 drinking.\n\n\\---\n\n\\*\\*I do not have access to the full text, but this is a cross-sectional survey of 2.5K Australian adults (i.e., an epidemiologic study).

The idea is that you prepare your calibration points artificially lower than their reported concentration. So a calibration point will be entered into the data analysis software as 1ppm, for instance, but prepared at 0.8ppm. and this is done for the entire calibration curve. There is a legal requirement to check your calibration with a second source, a standard that is from a separate source than what the calibration was prepped with. Basically using one vendor's standard to confirm another. These labs will calibrate low, but not so low that the second source is reported out of spec on the high side. In California, it looks like <\u00b130% recovery of the second source meets passing criteria. That means that reported values of samples can be up to 30% higher than reality, and the selection of the best bud only exacerbates that discrepancy.\n\n\nThis has the effect of all samples analyzed on that calibration curve being reported higher than reality. Ideally, a good calibration curve will have the second source come back as close to the standard's listed concentration as possible.\n\nAs an environmental analytical chemist, this is a deliberate and highly unethical action that indicates a rot from top to bottom at a lab.

Nitrogen-related and air pollution emissions of CM are also lower because of this efficiency and because CM is produced in a contained system without manure. CM production is energy-intensive, and therefore the energy mix used for production and in its supply chain is important. Using renewable energy, the carbon footprint is lower than beef and pork and comparable to the ambitious benchmark of chicken. Greenhouse gas profiles are different, being mostly CO2\u00a0for CM and more CH4\u00a0and N2O for conventional meats. Climate hotspots are energy used for maintaining temperature in reactors and for biotechnological production of culture medium ingredients.\n\nConclusions\n\nCM has the potential to have a lower environmental impact than ambitious conventional meat benchmarks, for most environmental indicators, most clearly agricultural land use, air pollution, and nitrogen-related emissions. The carbon footprint is substantially lower than that of beef. How it compares to chicken and pork depends on energy mixes. While CM production and its upstream supply chain are energy-intensive, using renewable energy can ensure that it is a sustainable alternative to all conventional meats.\n\nRecommendations\n\nCM producers should optimize energy efficiency and source additional renewable energy, leverage supply chain collaborations to ensure sustainable feedstocks, and search for the environmental optimum of culture medium through combining low-impact ingredients and high-performance medium formulation. Governments should consider this emerging industry\u2019s increased renewable energy demand and the sustainability potential of freed-up agricultural land.

However, the management of Western honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in urban areas may represent a new threat to wild bee communities. Urban beekeeping is commonly perceived as an environmentally friendly practice or a way to combat pollinator declines, when high-density beekeeping operations may actually have a negative influence on native and wild bee populations through floral resource competition and pathogen transmission. On the Island of Montr\u00e9al, Canada there has been a particularly large increase in beekeeping across the city. Over the years following a large bee diversity survey ending in 2013, there was an influx of almost three thousand honey bee colonies to the city. In this study, we examined the wild bee communities and floral resources across a gradient of honey bee abundances in urban greenspaces in 2020, and compared the bee communities at the same sites before and after the large influx of honey bees. Overall, we found a negative relationship between urban beekeeping, pollen availability, and wild bee species richness. We also found that honey bee abundance had the strongest negative effect on small (inter-tegular span <2.25 mm) wild bee species richness. Small bee species may be at higher risk in areas with abundant honey bee populations as their limited foraging range may reduce their access to floral resources in times of increased competition. Further research on the influence of urban beekeeping on native and wild pollinators, coupled with evidence-based beekeeping regulations, is essential to ensure cities contain sufficient resources to support wild bee diversity alongside managed honey bees.\n\nand from the discussion:\n\n>Beekeeping can be considered a form of livestock management, but unlike most livestock animals, a beekeeper is not required to provide sustenance for their bees. Honey bees are highly mobile organisms that are free to roam and exploit floral resources in their environment. As such, the introduction of honey bee colonies in cities usually does not coincide with an increase in the pollen and nectar required to sustain the wild bee community in addition to burgeoning honey bee populations (Casanelles-Abella & Moretti, 2022). Given that competition between bee species increases when floral resources are limited, the potential for negative interactions between honey bees and wild bees could be reduced by increasing pollen and nectar sources in tandem with new colonies. However, the addition of floral resources to the urban landscape does not address a negative influence of pathogen prevalence and spillover among and between bee species in high-density bee communities. Our study focused largely on wild bee species (with both native and exotic status), which declined with honey bee abundance. We found no influence of honey bee abundance specifically on bees native to our region, but our results showed that native bee species richness and abundance was positively influenced by floral richness and density. To support our native bees and encourage ecologically responsible urban beekeeping, introductions of honey bee colonies could be accompanied by deliberate planting of flowers known to provide abundant pollinator resources, especially those preferred by more vulnerable or specialist bee species. Additionally, the creation of more evidence-based frameworks to regulate urban beekeeping operations are paramount to develop sustainable beekeeping operations while protecting wild pollinator diversity in cities.", "score": 5, "author": "Hrmbee"}, {"id": "jg5d84n", "body": "I am very pro native bee and meh honey bee.

Both objective: social participation, community engagement, and number of chronic conditions and subjective: loneliness, perceived discrimination, and subjective health indicators were examined as possible mediators. The health and retirement study is a longitudinal panel survey consisting of a representative sample of US citizens over the age of 50. Analysis was based on data collected in 2010, 2014, and 2018. A total of 5590\u20135851 participants were included in the analyses. Path models were conducted to examine mediation, using 5000 bootstraps. Even after controlling for sociodemographic variables, there was a significant association between perceived neighborhood characteristics measured in 2010 and wellbeing measured in 2018. This association was partially mediated by loneliness, perceived discrimination, and subjective health measured in 2014, but not by community engagement, social participation, and number of chronic conditions. In a sensitivity analysis, some of the objective indicators partially accounted for the relationship between perceived neighborhood characteristics and the subjective indicators. The findings point to the importance of subjective mediators, rather than objective ones in explaining the association between perceived neighborhood characteristics and wellbeing. Hence, they call for further attention to the subjective characteristics of the neighborhood as important to older persons\u2019 wellbeing.", "score": 1, "author": "doctorizer"}]}

These toys are called \"nonstabilizer\" toys, and you need a lot of \"magic\" toys to figure out how to play with them. The more \"magic\" toys you need, the harder it is to figure out how to play with the toy.\n\nScientists study how much \"magic\" you need to play with different toys, and they measure this using something called \"mana\" and \"robustness of magic\" (RoM). They found that for some toys, the amount of \"magic\" you need changes over time, and it behaves differently if the toy is easy to figure out or really hard.\n\nIt turns out that understanding how much \"magic\" you need to play with these toys is important for understanding how things work in the universe.

However, diversity has thus far been limited to only two bat species. Here, we describe a new species of Icaronycteris based on two articulated skeletons discovered in the American Fossil Quarry northwest of Kemmerer, Wyoming. The relative stratigraphic position of these fossils indicates that they are the oldest bat skeletons recovered to date anywhere in the world. Phylogenetic analysis of Eocene fossil bats and living taxa places the new species within the family Icaronycteridae as sister to Icaronycteris index, and additionally indicates that the two Green River archaic bat families (Icaronycteridae and Onychonycteridae) form a clade distinct from known Old World lineages of archaic bats. Our analyses found no evidence that Icaronycteris? menui (France) nor I. sigei (India) belong to this clade; accordingly, we therefore remove them from Icaronycteridae. Taken in sum, our results indicate that Green River bats represent a separate chiropteran radiation of basal bats, and provide additional support for the hypothesis of a rapid radiation of bats on multiple continents during the early Eocene.", "score": 12, "author": "einsteinfrankenstein", "page_title": "Page Not Found | PLOS ONE"}]}

The research was widely shared on social media and featured prominently by certain Substack writers, predominantly because of its headline-grabbing claims about COVID-19 vaccine-related fatalities.

This post-publication peer review found that the methodology was inappropriate for proving causal inference of mortality and that the limitations were not adequately described. Critical issues were identified with the accuracy of data collection since there was no attempt to validate reported fatalities. Furthermore, the paper falsely stated that the research had been approved by the IRB of the Michigan State University Human Research Protection Program when in fact the study was exempt from such ethics approval.

The present study using data from UK biobank, included 316568 participants aged 37 to 73 years recruited from 22 centers between 2006 and 2010. Total physical activity (TPA), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA), assessed by metabolic equivalent task (MET) were used and Cox-proportional hazard models were performed in this study. The incidence rate of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality was 4.35 (4.29-4.42), 0.69 (0.67-0.72), and 2.23 (2.19-2.28) per 1000 person-years after an average follow-up time of 12.49 years. Lower levels of TPA, MVPA, and VPA were all independently associated with elevated risk of all-cause and cancer mortality. Lifetime depression was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause (HR=1.46, 95%CI: 1.40-1.52), CVD (HR=1.48, 95%CI: 1.33-1.64), and cancer mortality (HR=1.13, 95%CI: 1.06-1.21). Significant interactive effect of low levels of TPA, MVPA, and VPA and lifetime depression were associated with all-cause mortality. The risk of all-cause mortality associated with lifetime depression was deteriorated with low levels of physical activity.

Diamantinasaurus is a member of the dinosaur group Sauropoda, known for having small heads, long necks and tails, barrel-like bodies, and four columnar legs.\n\nLead researcher and palaeontologist Dr Stephen Poropat, from Curtin\u2019s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, said \u2018Ann\u2019 is the first sauropod dinosaur found in Australia to include most of the skull, and also the first Diamantinasaurus specimen to preserve a back foot.\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough to be involved in this Australian-first discovery.

A search of the PubMed, EMBASE,Cochrane Library databases and Web of Science was done to uncover double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of frequently used SGADs medicines in people with MDD. Qualifying studies were required to concentrate on the use of SGADs routinely used in MDD and to uncover data on treatment-emergent neurological SEs occurring within 12 weeks of therapy. Overall, 143 RCT studies containing 188 treatment arms were included in the meta-analyses. Most SGADs increased the risk of neurological SEs compared to placebo. The least tolerated antidepressants on the neurological tract were desvenlafaxine (OR=1.98; CI 0.85\u20134.65; p-value=0.12) and venlafaxine (OR=1.15; CI 0.96\u20131.38; p-value=0.13).

I know folks are posting here about any exercises does the same etc, yes to an extent, but being outside compounds the benefits. Water related activities seem to do so more than other natural settings. \n\n\"The effectiveness of physical activity on improving mental health may be due to several factors. One factor, social interaction, is associated with improved psychological health [30] and alleviation of depressive symptoms [28]. In service members, the connections made during sports programs may provide normalization of shared experiences and motivation to improve relationships [31,32,33,34]. Additionally, physical activity that occurs in the natural environment has a larger effect on depressive symptoms than physical activity indoors [35]. Hiking/walking in nature has demonstrated greater improvements in depression [36,\u00a037] and related symptoms [38,\u00a039] compared with walking in an indoor or urban area. Exercise programs that incorporate social interaction and the natural environment may uniquely support the rehabilitation of mental health disorders [40].\n\nAlthough hiking/walking is physical activity that can incorporate social interaction within a natural environment, a water-based environment or \u201cblue space\u201d [41] may confer greater benefits through unique sensory information created by the environment [42]. In support of this concept, Barton and Pretty (2010) [43] demonstrated that exercise outdoors near water generated greater mood improvements compared with exercise in a natural environment without water. Additionally, programs that encompass water-based activities within the natural environment have yielded psychological benefits for military veterans [44,45,46].\"", "score": 8, "author": "isawafit", "page_title": "Page Not Found"}, {"id": "jfx8hd9", "body": "Isn't that just exercise?\n\nAnd being outdoors?", "score": 7, "author": "McManGuy"}, {"id": "jfujd99", "body": "Or does having the energy and drive to go surfing or hiking mean one is less depressed?", "score": 33, "author": "biggreasyrhinos"}, {"id": "jfx9xkn", "body": "Having enough free time and money to go surfing and hiking can help...\n\nThere, I fixed it for you.", "score": 12, "author": "AndytheNewby"}, {"id": "jfxqyxm", "body": "I, too, enjoy not working", "score": 9, "author": "SketchingSomeStuff"}, {"id": "jfwhgzw", "body": "People get paid to research this\u2026", "score": 5, "author": "muffdivemcgruff"}, {"id": "jfxfcv5", "body": "[removed]", "score": 10, "author": "None"}, {"id": "jfvob1u", "body": "If I had enough money to be surfing and hiking, then I'd certainly feel more joyous!", "score": 5, "author": "Obnoobillate"}, {"id": "jfvogmd", "body": "Wait, so exercise helps depression??", "score": 5, "author": "SunknightofLake"}, {"id": "jfwgbdv", "body": "Yeah don\u2019t go skipping out on your second/third job for the sake of mental health.

However, we do not know how fast it is feasible to phase-out coal on the global scale. Historical experience of individual countries indicates feasible coal phase-out rates, but can these be upscaled to the global level and accelerated by deliberate action? To answer this question, we analyse 72 national coal power phase-out pledges and show that these pledges have diffused to more challenging socio-economic contexts and now cover 17% of the global coal power fleet, but their impact on emissions (up to 4.8 Gt CO2 avoided by 2050) remains small compared to what is needed for achieving Paris climate targets. We also show that the ambition of pledges is similar across countries and broadly in line with historical precedents of coal power decline. While some pledges strengthen over time, up to 10% have been weakened by the energy crisis caused by the Russo-Ukrainian war. We construct scenarios of coal power decline based on empirically-grounded assumptions about future diffusion and ambition of coal phase-out policies. We show that under these assumptions unabated coal power generation in 2022\u20132050 would be between the median generation in 2 \u00b0C-consistent IPCC AR6 pathways and the third quartile in 2.5 \u00b0C-consistent pathways. More ambitious coal phase-out scenarios require much stronger effort in Asia than in OECD countries, which raises fairness and equity concerns. The majority of the 1.5 \u00b0C- and 2 \u00b0C-consistent IPCC pathways envision even more unequal distribution of effort and faster coal power decline in India and China than has ever been historically observed in individual countries or pledged by climate leaders.", "score": 18, "author": "avogadros_number", "page_title": "ShieldSquare Captcha"}, {"id": "jfrzfxw", "body": "\"Some people just want to watch the world burn\".

We demonstrated that greater inequality produced more negative emotional responses, reduced desire for closeness, and harsher evaluations of one\u2019s partner, regardless of one\u2019s power role and the equitability of the income distribution.

They tend to believe someone homeless on the street doesn't have to be homeless because they could just go down to social services and get help.

The guy I might call a redneck hillbilly might be the one who pulls me out of the ditch. So, I avoid burning those bridges because most people in a small town will be helpful if they can be, because they fully understand we will all be the ones to need help eventually no matter how much money we make.

Additionally, nicotine ameliorated cellular energy metabolism disorders and deferred age-related deterioration and cognitive decline by stimulating neurogenesis, inhibiting neuroinflammation, and protecting organs from oxidative stress and telomere shortening.

Like I said, it resolved my skin problems, and it also has done some other good things for my overall health.  It has a slight stimulant effect comparable to when I smoked a pack/day so I feel that I have more energy, and my mind seems to be sharper, and aside from resolving skin \"problems\" it my skin also looks younger all around now.

Here, we propose that social media users overperceive levels of moral outrage felt by individuals and groups, inflating beliefs about intergroup hostility. Using a Twitter field survey, we measured authors\u2019 moral outrage in real time and compared authors\u2019 reports to observers\u2019 judgements of the authors\u2019 moral outrage. We find that observers systematically overperceive moral outrage in authors, inferring more intense moral outrage experiences from messages than the authors of those messages actually reported. This effect was stronger in participants who spent more time on social media to learn about politics. Preregistered confirmatory behavioural experiments found that overperception of individuals\u2019 moral outrage causes overperception of collective moral outrage and inflates beliefs about hostile communication norms, group affective polarization and ideological extremity. Together, these results highlight how individual-level overperceptions of online moral outrage produce collective overperceptions that have the potential to warp our social knowledge of moral and political attitudes.\"\n\n\n\"We focus on moral outrage\u2014a mixture of anger and disgust triggered by a perceived moral norm violation\"", "score": 8, "author": "Creative_soja"}, {"id": "jfumqtw", "body": "Is it the case that people overperceive the level of moral outrage in the posts they see online, or is it that the people posting underpeceive the level of moral outrage being expressed by their posts?

The extent that these changes have altered common age-related trends in psychological distress, where distress typically rises until midlife and then falls after midlife in both sexes, is unknown. We aimed to analyse whether long-term pre-pandemic psychological distress trajectories were disrupted during the pandemic, and whether these changes have been different across cohorts and by sex.  \n>  \n>Methods and findings  \n>  \n>We used data from three nationally representative birth cohorts comprising all people born in Great Britain in a single week of 1946 (National Survey of Health and Development, NSHD), 1958 (National Child Development Study, NCDS), or 1970 (British Cohort Study, BCS70). The follow-up data used spanned 39 years in NSHD (1982 to 2021), 40 years in NCDS (1981 to 2001), and 25 years in BCS70 (1996 to 2021). We used psychological distress factor scores, as measured by validated self-reported questionnaires (NSHD: Present State Examination, Psychiatric Symptoms Frequency, and 28- and 12-item versions of General Health Questionnaire; NCDS and BCS70: Malaise Inventory; all: 2-item versions of Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale and Patient Health Questionnaire).  \n>  \n>We used a multilevel growth curve modelling approach to model the trajectories of distress across cohorts and sexes and obtained estimates of the differences between the distress levels observed during the pandemic and those observed at the most recent pre-pandemic assessment and at the peak in the cohort-specific pre-pandemic distress trajectory, located at midlife. We further analysed whether pre-existing cohort and sex inequalities had changed with the pandemic onset using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach.  \n>  \n>**The analytic sample included 16,389 participants. By September/October 2020, distress levels had reached or exceeded the levels of the peak in the pre-pandemic life-course trajectories, with larger increases in younger cohorts (standardised mean differences \\[SMD\\] and 95% confidence intervals of SMDNSHD,pre-peak = \u22120.02 \\[\u22120.07, 0.04\\], SMDNCDS,pre-peak = 0.05 \\[0.02, 0.07\\], and SMDBCS70,pre-peak = 0.09 \\[0.07, 0.12\\] for the 1946, 1958, and 1970 birth cohorts, respectively).**  \n>  \n>**Increases in distress were larger among women than men, widening pre-existing sex inequalities (DiD and 95% confidence intervals of DiDNSHD,sex,pre-peak = 0.17 \\[0.06, 0.28\\], DiDNCDS,sex,pre-peak = 0.11 \\[0.07, 0.16\\], and DiDBCS70,sex,pre-peak = 0.11 \\[0.05, 0.16\\] when comparing sex inequalities in the pre-pandemic peak in midlife to those observed by September/October 2020).**  \n>  \n>As expected in cohort designs, our study suffered from high proportions of attrition with respect to the original samples. Although we used non-response weights to restore sample representativeness to the target populations (those born in the United Kingdom in 1946, 1958, and 1970, alive and residing in the UK), results may not be generalisable to other sections within the UK population (e.g., migrants and ethnic minority groups) and countries different than the UK.  \n>  \n>Conclusions  \n>  \n>Pre-existing long-term psychological distress trajectories of adults born between 1946 and 1970 were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women, who reached the highest levels ever recorded in up to 40 years of follow-up data.

However, the causal relationships underlying this association are still unclear. Physical activity can enhance brain functions, but healthy cognition may also promote engagement in physical activity. Here, we assessed the bidirectional relationships between physical activity and general cognitive functioning using Latent Heritable Confounder Mendelian Randomization (LHC-MR). Association data were drawn from two large-scale genome-wide association studies (UK Biobank and COGENT) on accelerometer-measured moderate, vigorous, and average physical activity (N\u2009=\u200991,084) and cognitive functioning (N\u2009=\u2009257,841). After Bonferroni correction, we observed significant LHC-MR associations suggesting that increased fraction of both moderate (b\u2009=\u20090.32, CI95%\u2009=\u2009[0.17,0.47], P\u2009=\u20092.89e\u2009\u2212\u200905) and vigorous physical activity (b\u2009=\u20090.22, CI95%\u2009=\u2009[0.06,0.37], P\u2009=\u20090.007) lead to increased cognitive functioning. In contrast, we found no evidence of a causal effect of average physical activity on cognitive functioning, and no evidence of a reverse causal effect (cognitive functioning on any physical activity measures). These findings provide new evidence supporting a beneficial role of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on cognitive functioning.\n\nand from the conclusion:\n\n>Our findings provide preliminary support for a unidirectional relation whereby higher levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity lead to improved cognitive functioning. These results underline the essential role of moderate and vigorous physical activity in maintaining or improving general cognitive functioning. Therefore, health policies and interventions that promote moderate and vigorous physical activity are relevant to improve cognitive functioning or to delay its decline.\n\nThough there's been some recent research suggesting that links between physical activity and cognition should be taken cautiously, this research seems to indicate otherwise.

In other species, linking brain activity to behavior is done by implanting electrodes and directly correlating electrical activity with observed animal behavior. However, because the octopus lacks any hard structure to which recording equipment can be anchored, and because it uses its eight flexible arms to remove any foreign object attached to the outside of its body, in vivo recording of electrical activity from untethered, behaving octopuses has thus far not been possible.    \n    \nHere, we describe a novel technique for inserting a portable data logger into the octopus and implanting electrodes into the vertical lobe system, such that brain activity can be recorded for up to 12 h from unanesthetized, untethered octopuses and can be synchronized with simultaneous video recordings of behavior.   \n  \nIn the brain activity, we identified several distinct patterns that appeared consistently in all animals.

To address these shortcomings, we developed Metaboverse, a user-friendly tool to facilitate data exploration and hypothesis generation. Here we introduce algorithms that leverage the metabolic network to extract complex reaction patterns from data. To minimize the impact of missing measurements within the network, we introduce methods that enable pattern recognition across multiple reactions. Using Metaboverse, we identify a previously undescribed metabolite signature that correlated with survival outcomes in early stage lung adenocarcinoma patients. Using a yeast model, we identify metabolic responses suggesting an adaptive role of citrate homeostasis during mitochondrial dysfunction facilitated by the citrate transporter, Ctp1.

Studies in rats showed that administration of exogenous L-lactate into the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus (HPC) improved decision-making and enhanced long-term memory formation, respectively. Although the molecular mechanisms by which L-lactate confers its beneficial effect are an active area of investigations, one recent study found that L-lactate supplementation results in a mild reactive oxygen species burst and induction of pro-survival pathways. To further investigate the molecular changes induced by L-lactate, we injected rats with either L-lactate or artificial CSF bilaterally into the dorsal HPC and collected the HPC after 60 minutes for mass spectrometry. We identified increased levels of several proteins that include SIRT3, KIF5B, OXR1, PYGM, and ATG7 in the HPC of the L-lactate treated rats. SIRT3 (Sirtuin 3) is a key regulator of mitochondrial functions and homeostasis and protects cells against oxidative stress. Further experiments identified increased expression of the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1) and mitochondrial proteins (ATPB, Cyt-c) as well as increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in the HPC of L-lactate treated rats. OXR1 (Oxidation resistance protein 1) is known to maintain mitochondrial stability. It mitigates the deleterious effects of oxidative damage in neurons by inducing a resistance response against oxidative stress. Together, our study suggests that L-lactate can induce expression of key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense. These findings create new research avenues to explore their contribution to the L-lactate\u2019s beneficial effect in cognitive functions as these cellular responses might enable neurons to generate more ATP to meet energy demand of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity as well as attenuate the associated oxidative stress.", "score": 1, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

A promising avenue includes agro-ecological practices such as rotational grazing of locally adapted ruminants. Additionally, growing consumer interest in pasture-finished meat (i.e., grass-fed) has raised questions about its nutritional composition. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the impact of two common finishing systems in North American bison-pasture-finished or pen-finished on concentrates for 146 d-on metabolomic, lipidomic, and fatty acid profiles of striploins (M. longissimus lumborum).\n\nRESULTS: Six hundred and seventy-one (671) out of 1570 profiled compounds (43%) differed between pasture- and pen-finished conditions (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;20 animals per group) (all, P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Relative to pasture-finished animals, the muscle of pen-finished animals displayed elevated glucose metabolites (~&#x2009;1.6-fold), triglycerides (~&#x2009;2-fold), markers of oxidative stress (~&#x2009;1.5-fold), and proteolysis (~&#x2009;1.2-fold). In contrast, pasture-finished animals displayed improved mitochondrial (~&#x2009;1.3-fold higher levels of various Krebs cycle metabolites) and carnitine metabolism (~&#x2009;3-fold higher levels of long-chain acyl carnitines) (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). Pasture-finishing also concentrated higher levels of phenolics (~&#x2009;2.3-fold), alpha-tocopherol (~&#x2009;5.8-fold), carotene (~&#x2009;2.0-fold), and very long-chain fatty acids (~&#x2009;1.3-fold) in their meat, while having lower levels of a common advanced lipoxidation (4-hydroxy-nonenal-glutathione; ~&#x2009;2-fold) and glycation end-product (N6-carboxymethyllysine; ~&#x2009;1.7-fold) (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05). In contrast, vitamins B5 , B6 , and C, gamma/beta-tocopherol, and three phenolics commonly found in alfalfa were&#x2009;~&#x2009;2.5-fold higher in pen-finished animals (all P&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05); suggesting some concentrate feeding, or grazing plants rich in those compounds, may be beneficial.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Pasture-finishing (i.e., grass-fed) broadly improves bison metabolic health and accumulates additional potential health-promoting compounds in their meat compared to concentrate finishing in confinement (i.e., pen-finished). Our data, however, does not indicate that meat from pen-finished bison is therefore unhealthy. The studied bison meat-irrespective of finishing practice-contained favorable omega 6:3 ratios (<&#x2009;3.2), and amino acid and vitamin profiles. Our study represents one of the deepest meat profiling studies to date (>&#x2009;1500 unique compounds), having revealed previously unrecognized differences in animal metabolic health and nutritional composition because of finishing mode. Whether observed nutritional differences have an appreciable effect on human health remains to be determined.", "score": -2, "author": "Meatrition"}]}

The illusory truth effect has also been demonstrated using a variety of different stimuli, including trivia statements (e.g., Bacon\u00a01979), fake news headlines (Pennycook et al.\u00a02018), product claims (Johar and Roggeveen\u00a02007), opinion statements (Arkes et al.\u00a01989), rumors (DiFonzo et al.\u00a02016), and misinformation about observed events (Zaragoza and Mitchell\u00a01996).

Furthermore, the effect does not depend upon the source of the statements (Begg et al.\u00a01992) and occurs even when participants are explicitly told that the source of the statements is unreliable (Henkel and Mattson\u00a02011) or when the initial statement had a qualifier that cast doubt on the statement\u2019s validity (Stanley et al.\u00a02019). Further evidence of the robustness of this effect comes from studies showing that the illusory truth effect even occurs when the repeated statements are highly implausible (e.g.,\u00a0The earth is a perfect square;\u00a0Fazio et al.\u00a02019) or when the repeated statements directly contradict participants\u2019 prior knowledge (e.g.,\u00a0The fastest land animal is the leopard;\u00a0Fazio et al.\u00a02015).", "score": 1, "author": "rutefoot"}, {"id": "jflawvy", "body": "Ok \nBy why is Trump still around then ?...name calling is in every single phrase he pronounces, I couldn't believe how he deliberately insulted Hillary Clinton, hundreds of times during the first campaign and how he carried on against Biden recently...", "score": 1, "author": "MuscuMass01"}, {"id": "jfm6u83", "body": "It's not just politicians.

These rhythms can be disrupted by chronic stress or synthetic glucocorticoid therapy, resulting in side effects including impaired memory, mood, and sleep. Here, we show that 5-d treatment with methylprednisolone induces prolonged activation of glucocorticoid receptors and consequent binding at glucocorticoid regulatory elements in the core clock gene Period 1, in the hippocampus. Furthermore, disruption of circadian hippocampal gene regulation was evident, along with loss of circadian variation in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and impaired hippocampal memory. Together, these data demonstrate dysregulated hippocampal function during long-acting glucocorticoid treatment and further support the importance of devising improved regimens of glucocorticoid therapy that recapitulate endogenous glucocorticoid rhythmicity.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nDisrupted circadian activity is associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders. A major coordinator of circadian biological systems is adrenal glucocorticoid secretion which exhibits a pronounced preawakening peak that regulates metabolic, immune, and cardiovascular processes, as well as mood and cognitive function. Loss of this circadian rhythm during corticosteroid therapy is often associated with memory impairment. Surprisingly, the mechanisms that underlie this deficit are not understood. In this study, in rats, we report that circadian regulation of the hippocampal transcriptome integrates crucial functional networks that link corticosteroid-inducible gene regulation to synaptic plasticity processes via an intrahippocampal circadian transcriptional clock. Further, these circadian hippocampal functions were significantly impacted by corticosteroid treatment delivered in a 5-d oral dosing treatment protocol. Rhythmic expression of the hippocampal transcriptome, as well as the circadian regulation of synaptic plasticity, was misaligned with the natural light/dark circadian-entraining cues, resulting in memory impairment in hippocampal-dependent behavior. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how the transcriptional clock machinery within the hippocampus is influenced by corticosteroid exposure, leading to adverse effects on critical hippocampal functions, as well as identifying a molecular basis for memory deficits in patients treated with long-acting synthetic corticosteroids.", "score": 4, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Further experiments showed that macrolides block autophagic flux by inhibiting lysosomal acidification. Additionally, azithromycin, a representative macrolide antibiotic, induced the accumulation of ROS, and stimulated the ISR and the activation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and TFE3 in a ROS-dependent manner.

We develop a tracing technology that can simultaneously and quantitatively follow the metabolism of multiple fatty acids to study the triglyceride futile substrate cycle directly and with molecular species resolution. Our approach is based on alkyne fatty acid tracers and mass spectrometry. The triglyceride cycling is connected to modification of released fatty acids by elongation and desaturation. Through cycling and modification, saturated fatty acids are slowly converted to monounsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid to arachidonic acid.

RCP 8.5 / SSP5 - 8.5) which is not our current emissions trajectory. In fact, while RCP 8.5 has its uses for modelling it is so improbable it might as well be impossible and is not a realistic scenario. RCP 8.5 relies on there being no climate policy, as well as a dramatically increased reliance on fossil fuels, in particular coal. RCP 8.5 has a CO2eq of > 1000 ppm around 2100. Current CO2 emissions are ~415 ppm and increasing at a rate of ~2.27 ppm per year. At our current rate, with 77 years until 2100 we would add 174.79 ppm CO2 (ie. 589.79 ppm by 2100). That means we would need to emit ~7.6 ppm CO2 per year for 77 years to achieve 1000 ppm CO2. Methane emissions and other sources will decrease this value but not significantly and highlights how improbable such a scenario currently is. \n\n(3) The lead author of [Multi-proxy constraints on Atlantic circulation dynamics since the last ice age](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01140-3?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ngeo) had the following to say: \"We find that during the last ice age the Atlantic circulation was about 30% weaker than today, and that it never fully collapsed even when large freshwater fluxes entered the North Atlantic.\"\n\nWhy didn't the authors attempt to model under more realistic climate projections?

Genetic disruption of mitochondrial respiratory components either by mutation or RNAi greatly extends the lifespan in yeast, worms, and drosophila. This has given rise to the idea that pharmacologically inhibiting mitochondrial function would be a workable strategy for postponing aging. Toward this end, we used a transgenic worm strain that expresses the firefly luciferase enzyme widely to evaluate compounds by tracking real-time ATP levels. We identified chrysin and apigenin, which reduced ATP production and increased the lifespan of worms. Mechanistically, we discovered that chrysin and apigenin transiently inhibit mitochondrial respiration and induce an early ROS, and the lifespan-extending effect is dependent on transient ROS formation. We also show that AAK-2/AMPK, DAF-16/FOXO, and SKN-1/NRF-2 are required for chrysin or apigenin-mediated lifespan extension. Temporary increases in ROS levels trigger an adaptive response in a mitohormetic way, thereby increasing oxidative stress capacity and cellular metabolic adaptation, finally leading to longevity. Thus, chrysin and apigenin represent a class of compounds isolated from natural products that delay senescence and improve age-related diseases by inhibiting mitochondrial function and shed new light on the function of additional plant-derived polyphenols in enhancing health and delaying aging. Collectively, this work provides an avenue for pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial function and the mechanism underlining their lifespan-extending properties.", "score": 3, "author": "basmwklz"}]}

Although PKC activation induces oxidative stress, leading to the cellular dysfunction in various cell types, the correlation between PKC and senescence has not been reported in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). Several studies have indicated cellular senescence is accompanied by phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss and that an interaction exists between PTEN and PKC. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether PTEN and PKC are associated with VSMC senescence and to investigate the mechanism involved. We found hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decreased PTEN expression and increased PKC\u03b4 phosphorylation. Moreover, H2O2 upregulated the NOX1 subunits, p22phox and p47phox, and induced VSMC senescence via p53-p21 signaling pathway. We identified PKC\u03b4 activation contributed to VSMC senescence through activation of NOX1 and ROS production. **However, fisetin inhibited cellular senescence induced by the PTEN-PKC\u03b4-NOX1-ROS signaling pathway, and this anti-aging effect was attributed to reduced ROS production caused by suppressing NOX1 activation. These results suggest that the PTEN-PCK\u03b4 signaling pathway is directly related to senescence via NOX1 activation and that the downregulation of PKC\u03b4 by flavonoids provides a potential means of treating age-associated diseases.**", "score": 7, "author": "cleare7"}]}

The differences are that Bipolar appears to be physical-based, whether that is genetic, epigenetic, hormonal or almost like mini-seizures or epilepsy, or something else, we don't quite know, there are just theories. The fact that some anti-seizure drugs do seem to have effect, does kind of make me feel like having overactive brain signals is a good candidate for at least some types of bipolar. Either way there is an inability to regular emotions and responses, and moods swings can be cyclical or mixed. Narcissism however is generally agreed to be partly trauma-based, partly personality based. Upbringing by an abusive or neglectful parent can create a Narcissistic child. Basically the person becomes stuck in the fight or flight response because of childhood experience, anything that could harm their ego is seen as a threat, prompting outbursts of anger and insults. They can't handle or accept blame, can't think about others feelings because they are so focused on protecting themselves. Trauma + natural lack of empathy, and you will get a narcissist, essentially. Lacking Empathy makes it have some overlap with things like antisocial personality disorder as well (interestingly, APD can also exhibit regulation issues). Being Trauma-created is something it shared with Borderline-Personality disorder as well (recently it's been shown BPD seems to be a form of PTSD). BPD, Bipolar and Narcissism are a cluster of disorders that all look extremely similar, all having poor-regulation control, the primary differences beeing trauma-tied versus not trauma-tied, and how much empathy the 'base' personality has (so it might be a sliding scale of PTSD: (normal empathy) PTSD -> BPD -> Narcissism (Less Empathy).) \n\nThe thing is, when you are in the extremes of bipolar, overreacting based on inability to regulate your emotions, you are going to trigger 'fight or flight' easily over anything you perceive as threatening, which is likely to be disproportionate because of your bipolar. So yeah, obviously the reactions have a similar mechanism. This might suggest that bipolar medications might be able to help those with explosive variations of Narcissism have more stable moods, but Narcissists almost never seek help, because that would mean they have to admit something was wrong about their actions, which they won't.", "score": 4, "author": "M00n_Slippers"}, {"id": "jfevt9e", "body": "mania gives you narcissistic tendencies", "score": 7, "author": "co5mosk-read"}, {"id": "jfeenjb", "body": "This is horse shite.

It is, however, possible that NPD and the bipolar disorders are more closely related than implied by their segregation into the separate superordinate categories of personality disorders and mood disorders. Whereas narcissism is considered to be a life-course, stable trait and the bipolar disorders are characterized by episodes of mania and depression, there is considerable research indicating that narcissism may be linked to mood instability (including depression) and bipolar disorder may have a pervasive personality component (i.e., hypomanic personality).

Similarly, long-term memories can be shaped to fit our expectations, which can generate false memories. However, it is generally assumed that short-term memory for percepts formed just 1 or 2 seconds ago accurately represents the percepts as they were at the time of perception. Here 4 experiments consistently show that within this timeframe, participants go from reliably reporting what\u00a0was\u00a0there (perceptual inference accurately reflecting the bottom-up input), to erroneously but with high confidence reporting what they\u00a0expected\u00a0to be there (memory report strongly influenced by top-down expectations). Together, these experiments show that expectations can reshape perceptual representations over short time scales, leading to what we refer to as\u00a0short-term memory (STM) illusions. These illusions appeared when participants saw a memory display which contained real and pseudo-letters (i.e. mirrored letters). Within seconds after the memory display disappeared, high confidence memory errors increased substantially. This increase in errors over time indicates that the high confidence errors do not (purely) result from incorrect perceptual encoding of the memory display. Moreover, high confidence errors occurred mainly for pseudo-to-real letter memories, and much less often for real-to-pseudo-letter memories, indicating that visual similarity is not the primary cause of this memory-bias. Instead \u2018world knowledge\u2019 (e.g., which orientation letters usually have) appear to drive these STM illusions. Our findings support a predictive processing view of the formation and maintenance of memory in which all memory stages, including STM, involve integration of bottom-up memory input with top-down predictions, such that prior expectations can shape memory traces.\"", "score": 11, "author": "isawafit", "page_title": "Page Not Found | PLOS ONE"}, {"id": "jf96syg", "body": "Ya like where tf are my car keys", "score": 23, "author": "Moneyshot_ITF"}, {"id": "jf9e44o", "body": "To be honest, I don't really need science to tell me that, I've seen first-hand evidence of it countless times.", "score": 19, "author": "hidden_secret"}, {"id": "jf94v54", "body": "Not surprising.

The paper was published in the prestigious American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nProf. Bar-Haim explains: \"About 4-12% of the population will develop social anxiety disorder at some stage of their lives. Quite often, people with this disorder avoid social situations - at a heavy interpersonal, professional, and economic price. At present, psychiatry and psychology offer sufferers two types of treatment: SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) drugs, such as Cipralex, and CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy). CBT requires 12-20 sessions with a qualified clinical psychologist, in which symptoms are relieved through gradual exposure to the cause of anxiety. Thus, while effective, CBT is a complex treatment necessitating the presence of a highly skilled therapist and requiring patients to face their deepest fears, a requirement that often leads to treatment dropout.\n\nhttps://www.news-medical.net/news/20230403/Study-demonstrates-an-effective-technology-driven-alternative-to-psychiatric-medications-for-social-anxiety.aspx", "score": 4, "author": "Wagamaga", "page_title": "\r\n\tStudy demonstrates an effective technology-driven alternative to psychiatric medications for social anxiety\r\n"}, {"id": "jfejrwe", "body": "This better not be E meters", "score": 1, "author": "iheartgold"}]}

In contrast, selfie editing is related to negative self-evaluations both generally and specific to appearance.

Its northernmost occurrence has been reported from late Pleistocene deposits in Medicine Hat, Alberta, representing the only record of the taxon in Canada. However, the dentary upon which these reports were based has never been described or illustrated. The Medicine Hat specimen is badly crushed and appears to be from an old individual, which precludes the observation of adult diagnostic morphological characters. Geometric morphometrics were used to test the previous identification of the Medicine Hat dentary. A landmark-based principal component analysis and a canonical variates analysis suggests that the specimen more strongly resembles dire wolf specimens than grey wolf (Canis lupus). Identification of the Medicine Hat specimen as C. dirus supports it as the northernmost occurrence of this species in North America. However, we note the potential for allometric relationships that may confound differentiation between grey and dire wolves based on the morphology of the dentary.

Data collection for this cross-sectional study was performed via an online Qualtrics survey from 10,050 adults aged 40\u2013100 years. Nutritional status was measured using the 24-item short-form Dietary Screening Tool (DST) twice: before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. The DST questions were categorized based on MyPlate items, along with fat, sugar, and sweet items, as well as nutritional supplement intake. In addition, the total DST score was calculated for each participant, which categorized them into one of three groups: \u201cat risk\u201d, \u201cpossible risk\u201d, and \u201cnot at risk\u201d. The results revealed that the consumption of grains, fruit, lean protein, and dairy decreased significantly, while the consumption of fat, sugar, and sweet items increased significantly due to COVID-19. The biggest decreases in consumption of food subcategories were related to whole grain bread and cereal, followed by fruit as a snack, in comparison with other types of grain and fruit. No changes in the consumption of vegetables, processed meat, or supplement intake were seen. The total DST score showed that, before and since COVID-19, the overall nutrition status of adult Americans has been at risk. In addition, of those participants who were not at risk before COVID-19, 28.5% were either at risk or at possible risk since COVID-19; moreover, of those participants who were at possible risk before COVID-19, 21% were at risk since COVID-19.

And despite the amount of research behind finding a way to counter, or cure, this often deadly condition, there's been only glimmers of hope for sufferers.\r  \n\r  \nBut a major breakthrough might be around the corner, with scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) testing a world-first mRNA medicine packaged up in tiny nanoparticles that not only reversed peanut allergies in mice but equipped the body with the microbiological tools needed to stop the often-life-threatening condition developing.\r  \n\r\r  \n\u201cAs far as we can find, mRNA has never been used for an allergic disease,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Andr\u00e9 Nel, a professor at UCLA. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that our platform can work to calm peanut allergies, and we believe it may be able to do the same for other allergens, in food and drugs, as well as autoimmune conditions.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nTaking a cue from COVID-19 vaccines, the team packaged up mRNA inside a nanoparticle and delivered it to the liver, where it instructed specific cells to tolerate peanut proteins. The researchers focused on the liver in particular because of its tolerance with foreign substances and it being home to antigen-presenting cells, which help train the immune system to tolerate foreign proteins, rather than attack them.\r  \n\r  \nIt builds on 2021 research by the team, which saw a nanoparticle deliver a protein fragment, known as an epitope, to the liver to alleviate egg allergies in mice. In 2022 the researchers uncovered the epitope connected to peanut allergies.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky enough to choose the correct epitope, there\u2019s an immune mechanism that puts a damper on reactions to all of the other fragments,\u201d said Nel. \u201cThat way, you could take care of a whole ensemble of epitopes that play a role in disease.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThis is where mRNA came into the picture. In a similar way to how mRNA vaccines encode the COVID-19 spike protein to mount a defense, the mRNA packaged inside this nanoparticle encodes for a specific epitope.\r  \n\r  \nThrough several successful trials on mice, the scientists found that the nanoparticle treatment significantly boosted the animals\u2019 tolerance of peanut protein.\r  \n\r  \nThe researchers are now confident their treatment will go to clinical trials within three years and that it has the potential to be adapted for allergies, since the mRNA payload can code for different kinds of epitopes. They\u2019re even looking into whether it could be adapted to treat type 1 diabetes.\r  \n\r  \nThe study was published in the journal [ACS Nano - links to PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36853930/).\r  \n\r  \nSource: [Details from the Newsroom at University of California, Los Angeles](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/nanoparticle-mrna-possible-treatment-peanut-allergies)", "score": 184, "author": "TheGuvnor247", "page_title": "Use of a Liver-Targeting Immune-Tolerogenic mRNA Lipid Nanoparticle Platform to Treat Peanut-Induced Anaphylaxis by Single- and Multiple-Epitope Nucleotide Sequence Delivery - PubMed"}, {"id": "jf1w08g", "body": "This is it nuts.

In addition to humans, many animal species depend on forest ecosystems, most of which are insects. Insects are often considered only as pests in the forest, as is shown, for example, by reports on bark beetles or cockchafers. While temporal changes in populations of potential insect pests are well studied, little is known about the status and trend of the many other fascinating insect species in forests.\n\nA new study led by researchers from the Technical Universities of Darmstadt and Munich in collaboration with other researchers now shows how the populations of 1,805 insect species have developed in German forests from 2008 to 2017. To the researchers' surprise, the number of individuals has declined over time for the majority of the evaluated species.\n\nThis is particularly surprising when compared to agricultural land, where the type of land use has changed over time and intensified, for example due to more effective pesticides, the removal of edge structures, or increased cultivation of corn.

However, the few existing examples of these landforms are restricted to small areas of the seafloor, limiting our understanding of future rates of grounding-line retreat and, hence, sea-level rise. Here we use bathymetric data to map more than 7,600 corrugation ridges across 30,000\u2009km^(2) of the mid-Norwegian shelf. The spacing of the ridges shows that pulses of rapid grounding-line retreat, at rates ranging from 55 to 610\u2009m\u2009day^(\u22121), occurred across low-gradient (\u00b11\u00b0) ice-sheet beds during the last deglaciation. These values far exceed all previously reported rates of grounding-line retreat across the satellite and marine-geological records. The highest retreat rates were measured across the flattest areas of the former bed, suggesting that near-instantaneous ice-sheet ungrounding and retreat can occur where the grounding line approaches full buoyancy. Hydrostatic principles show that pulses of similarly rapid grounding-line retreat could occur across low-gradient Antarctic ice-sheet beds even under present-day climatic forcing. Ultimately, our results highlight the often-overlooked vulnerability of flat-bedded areas of ice sheets to pulses of extremely rapid, buoyancy-driven retreat.", "score": 5, "author": "avogadros_number", "page_title": "Rapid, buoyancy-driven ice-sheet retreat of hundreds of metres per day | Nature"}]}

The traditional CLPM showed bidirectional negative associations between composite materialism and life satisfaction and strong negative bidirectional association for the happiness facet, but positive effects of the centrality facet on life satisfaction. However, and importantly, the RI-CLPM revealed that these relations exist predominantly between people. Within people, materialism does not impact life satisfaction, but life satisfaction does impact the happiness facet negatively.
