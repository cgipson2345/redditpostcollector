Any given item may need to have the following information discovered: appearance-identification (the fact that this scroll is labeled \"GARVEN DEH\" for instance; this can normally be seen immediately, but factors such as blindness and hallucination can lead to it being unknown); type-identification (e.g., the fact that \"yellow potion\" in this game happens to be a potion of hallucination); beatitude (blessed/uncursed/cursed); whether or not it is proofed against rust/fire/etc.; and a special field whose meaning varies depending on item class, e.g., enchantment for weapons and armor, charge level for wands, etc.  Actually, there are some other things too, but they piggyback on the ones I listed (e.g., if you know the number of charges you also know the recharge count).

What language?  \nBy this I mean what is a good place to start. I know the sidebar is recommending Python 3 and it does seem like Python does have quite a nice and readable syntax, especially for a beginner like me. However it also seems it's slow and doesn't handle bigger projects very well. So is this really the best option? If I start making a RL and then decide that \"hey, this is brilliant, I'm gonna extend this and make it huge\" I would like to be able to just keep going and not have to switch and learn a completely new language all over again. So maybe its just plainly \"better\" to start with another language straight away, like C# (might be cool if you want to go in to unity and graphics and stuffs?), C++, JS, Java or something completely different. Or would Python still be the better option?  \n\n2. If Python still is the better option (and i kind of hope it is,  cause Python still seems like a rather beginner friendly language) Would it be better to go with pure Python or should I check out the PyGame thingie thing that are also listed and have videos? Also, as a followup and general question. What exactly is PyGame? Is it another language or is it a package that have premade code used for games or is it something completely different that I just don't understand. Is there any reason to use PyGame over just regular Python (if we talk about the guides listed)?  \n\n3. If I want my game to be playable in the browser, so friends and family and others doesn't actually have to DL anything could it still be done in any of language or should I maybe try to check out HTML/JS or something else?  \n\n4. What is Rust? Seriously, never even heard of this language. What is its main use and purpose? Does it suit itself well for RL? I'm seriously curious, i tried to look for it myself but apparently my googlefu skills aint what they used to be.  \n\n\nI think that was all for now.

There's basically two paths for what your project wants to be when it grows up. Maybe you're doing something like The Next Dwarf Fortress (not strictly a roguelike, but close enough architecture-wise). Ie. hundreds of simulated entities live at once, each running non-trivial AI. This is where performance will actually start to matter and a project in Python might end up being in trouble. The traditional roguelike option is The Next NetHack. That's lots and lots of content and logic complexity, but the actual gameplay is going to be a pretty constrained map, amount of live entities in play usually well below 100 and generally not that much number crunching per frame. You're going to have challenges managing all the program complexity no matter which language you pick, but there aren't any fundamental performance bottlenecks where the Python runtime will keep you back. So, Python is fine, you can do a complete, complex classical roguelike in it.\n\nRust gets you two things. It's on par with C++ for performance, so even if your project wants to do massive simulation each frame, if you use Rust you have a shot at wringing everything you can get from the machine. The second thing is WebAssembly integration that lets you port the game to run in a modern browser with the same codebase. However, the \"on par with C++\" thing also means it has the hardest learning curve of all your options. Picking up Rust is going to mean your initial project will be much more \"learning Rust\" than \"making a game\". I've got a reasonably solid RL project and one successful 7DRL done with it, so it is suitable for RL dev, but it took some work to come up with an architecture that looks like it can handle a larger game. The overall feel of current Rust is quite a lot like C/C++ game development in the 1990s (think iD Software making the original Quake), you're close to metal and there aren't that many existing complex game engines to work on top of so you get to build your own stuff.

I don't see it as a bad thing, but as an obvious sign of how computer technology got introduced into our everyday life. The proposed *gap* between what we call \"old\" and \"new\" roguelike game came as a testimony of the lenghtiness of the forementioned process. Ordinary games (like Sokoban, Asteroids, Space Invaders etc.) had all the markings of the software industry, thus were easily obtainable and undoubtedly more popular with general population. At that, more simple and innocent time, all the programmers and CS uni students weren't just plain users. They were comfortable with running terminal programs, had a sort of appreciation towards passing multiple console arguments and generally were in awe of all the versatility and potency of such tools.\n\nAn original roguelike game would've been that way. It would sit still on a remote server, waiting for a telnet user to log in and try it out. It was designed so that different terminals could make the most out of it, without the need of system-specific program builds. It was an elaborate effort also, with lots of options and commands; had a user's manual (help file) like most of the programs those days. You could've found out who else was playing that game, be it some of your uni peers or perhaps a programmer who made yet another, powerful program you were using. You either have had enough luck or skill to do a really good run, in a most certainly difficult game a vast majority of your friends wouldn't understand.\n\nWhat eventually came to be out of that logic is that fans of the genre appreciate how they're still able to play a good old roguelike game using just about any computer with an internet connection. Those in-development ones perhaps lack networking capabilities, but still can be downloaded, built from sources and played on just about any platform. A fair number of programmers in love with designing computer games begun creating a roguelike game of sorts, paying a sort of tribute to how they first discovered ways to create their own. Their strength in numbers is now greater than ever, with lots of people discussing particular rl games they're fond of, and the next generation of programmers influencing the genre with modern ideas.\n\nAt least for me, a roguelike game will always be *a game from programmers for programmers*. It doesn't have to feature elves nor upstairs and downstairs, as it also mustn't be bound to a terminal.

For starters, roguelikes are a subgenre of the dungeon-crawling genre, and *Spelunky* is most certainly *not* a dungeon crawler (i.e. a small-scale tactics game with a heavy exploration aspect). Moreover, *Spelunky* cannot be said to have \"roguelike elements\" either. Because, contrary to what fagots who know as much about videogames as Roger Ebert think, what makes a roguelike a roguelike is not the randomized stage layout, but the game's LACK OF A CONVENTIONAL SAVE FEATURE. This is why, for example, a game like Ancient Domains of Mystery, and others like it, are still considered roguelikes despite featuring environments that are to a large extent pregenerated. So what makes a roguelike a roguelike, as I've already said \u2014 or, to be more precise, what makes a *dungeon-crawler* a roguelike \u2014 is, above all else, the lack of a conventional save feature. This, however, does not fucking mean THAT EVERY GAME THAT DOES NOT ALLOW SAVING IS A FUCKING ROGUELIKE. Because, if that were so, EVERY SINGLE ARCADE GAME EVER MADE WOULD BE A FUCKING ROGUELIKE, FAGOTS! \u2014 So get your shit straight: roguelikes are dungeon crawlers from which the ability to save (or, to be more precise, the ability to continue from a particular save point *more than once*) has been REMOVED, thereby arcade-izing the genre \u2014 but this doesn't mean that any genre from which saving has been removed is a roguelike; it's just a genre which has come closer to arcade (or early-console...) design sensibilities. What the fagots are basically doing here is the equivalent of looking up the definition of, say wolf on *Wikipedia* (\"the largest wild member of the *Canidae* family of carnivorous and omnivorous mammals\"), and then coming out and saying that, because piranhas for example are carnivorous, they are a subspecies of wolves \u2014 wolf-fish, perhaps, a \"fishy\" variation of a wolf, a fish with \"wolfish elements\". But a wolf is A MAMMAL, fagots, whilst a pirhanha is A FISH \u2014 you can't wrench a subspecies out of its species and arbitrarily pick out some of its characteristics (and moreover *subsidiary* characteristics...) and use them as an excuse to insert it into ANOTHER FUCKING SPECIES for christsake. How can I explain this elementary concept to you more plainly? Here's another example: a metroidvania is a platformer involving lots of saving and backtracking. But many FPSes (or adventure games, or dungeon crawlers, or flight simulators, or, or, or...) also involve lots of saving and backtracking, yet no one calls these games \"metroidvania FPSes\" or \"FPSes with metroidvania elements\". And the same goes for the randomized stages \u2014 simply consider that there are countless games from other genres which employ this feature (e.g. strategy games like *Heroes of Might & Magic*, or space exploration games in the style of *Elite*, or even ancient action stuff like *Asteroids* for christsake) and yet no one calls them roguelikes, or claims that they have \"roguelike elements\". In other words, \"permadeath\" and random stage generation ARE FAR TOO COMMON (AND MOREOVER *SUBSIDIARY*) DESIGN FEATURES, and \"roguelike\" far too specialized a genre label to warrant bandying it about from genre to genre in such an indiscriminate fashion. In short, the notion that *Spelunky* is a \"roguelike\" or has \"roguelike elements\" is pure humbug that (regardless of how and by whom it began) its creator is more than happy to perpetuate for the simple reason \u2014 and this is the crux of the matter \u2014 that the roguelike subgenre has a (well-deserved) reputation for being \"hardcore\", a reputation which Mr. Yu would dearly love to co-opt for his ludicrous little \"indie sensation\". So I've got news for you, Mr. Yu: you are not hardcore, you are just a fagot who abuses videogame terminology in order to trick others into granting you more respect than you deserve \u2014 and, considering how pathetic your best game so far is, guess what: you don't deserve any.\n", "score": 2, "author": "thrwa3"}, {"id": "dcjtcvy", "body": "if it doesn't run over telnet and only use base ASCII, it's not a roguelike. there are no exceptions.", "score": 2, "author": "None"}, {"id": "dciluf4", "body": "Worrying too much about the \"roguelike\" definition is just quibbling over semantics.\n\nBy my personal definition, if it's a tile/grid-based, turn-based roleplaying game with predominantly procedural generated maps played from a perspective of an individual, it's probably roguelike enough.  \n\nI don't brook any guff with the idea of a \"roguelight,\" if you don't do at least that much then you might as well just call it something else.

In addition, our game has an uncommon \u2014possibly new\u2014 concept called a \"stumble!\" The four possible attack outcomes were critical hits, normal performances, stumbles, and misses.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This month, for the first time, we were able to extensively play our own game to get a sense of what works and doesn't. I was surprised to feel an immediate distaste for a mechanic we added:\u00a0critical hits.\n\nSo why did we keep stumbling but not criticals? Stumbling is simply the opposite of a critical, after all. As for stumbling, the mechanic is meant to partially replace and soften the misfortune of missing an attack as it causes an attack to do half damage overall. You'll notice from the picture that we made misses very rare by default. There are three underlying opinions that led me to remove criticals instead. (I only include one here for brevity's sake, since the other two require context).\n\n*Videogames ought to value elegant design*. Mark Brown of *Game Maker's Toolkit* on YouTube inspired this in me as he holds this belief much stronger than I do, enough to host ~~and pay for~~ *(EDIT: I checked and Mark didn't actually have a cash prize for the winner.)* a competition to see who could make the most elegant game! Our total of four outcomes was more complicated than *Fire Emblem* and therefore needlessly less elegant. Sure, *Pokemon* has four types (miss, not very effective, hit, super-effective) but keep in mind that *Pokemon* is nothing but combat whereas Roguelikes and Tactical RPGs make spatial demands of the player. Furthermore, fewer outcomes mean less for us developers to balance, which can be a win-win.\n\nEDIT 2: u/Four-Factors-Model points out that I didn't clarify what the vision is for our game in the way that relates to our personal choice. To quote something I wrote down below, \"our game is trying to present the world as a place of struggle and failure.\" Dream-Prison Wanderer just so happens to be a horror game in which the hit system applies not just to the player but to allies and enemies too.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nWhat do you think of that (partial) reasoning?

The first two relate to type effectiveness, the latter apply to everything. You can \"critically hit!\" and also get \"it's not very effective...\"\n\nSecondly, as a personal opinion, the concept of \"how bad\" my attack will be is inherently worse than wondering \"how good\" my attack will be. If the only outcomes of an attack are either success, failure, or partial failure, then the best case scenario *is that I don't fail*. That's simply not fun. If instead my options are fail, hit, or critical success, then every attack has a chance of being *amazing* by itself.\n\nAs far as simplicity in design, there is nothing over-complicated about the concept of critical hits. It also shouldn't be too hard to factor into your math. Like you said, it is literally the opposite of a fumble/miss. If it feels like a problem, you might want to give the player crit resistance.\n\nI'm curious as to what felt bad about criticals, yet didn't feel bad with misses/fumbles? If anything, my first reaction would be to cull the 'worse' end of outcomes first, not the 'best'. For example, maybe remove misses altogether, but lower the damage floor of fumbles. Or lower the overall percentage that miss/fumbling has, etc. Or maybe modify the damage bonus that critical strikes give if they feel \"too good.\"\n\nJust from a strictly fantasy perspective, if your character is making an attack with a weapon, your character could miss, fall over, get parried/blocked, get a glancing blow, sever a limb or artery, or potentially stab the enemy directly in their heart, or neck, or head. By only allowing misses, fumbles, and regular hits, you are basically making the character \"bad\" because they are incapable of landing a strong or serious blow.

Well, no. Not if you've made missing uncommon. In that frame, uncommon results are just messing up your ability to strategize. \n\nFor criticals to give surprise while maintaining strategy, I think they'd have to debuff, not deal more damage.

Blindly adhering to elegance, simplicity, or any other word without considering your decision's effects on the player's experience is not a good approach to design.\n\nIf you are trying to create some kind of power fantasy experience, obviously critical misses, partial hits, fumbles, etc., don't contribute well to that. You would instead probably want to have normal hits, critical hits, super critical hits, extremely critical hits, etc. In other words, you want to raise the damage/outcome floor so that you can keep showing the player big numbers and maintain the power fantasy experience.\n\nIf you're instead trying to simulate some kind of grueling crawl from zero to hero, showing your character's initial lack of skill through the use of critical misses, stumbling, glancing blows, and completely removing their ability to land critical hits may all contribute to creating an experience that feels difficult, draining, and even unfair.\n\nIt's all about how you want the player to feel and think about while they are playing your game. If you haven't decided what the experience of playing your game is supposed to look like, it's a little misguided to base design decisions purely on what you think is most \"elegant\". Each decision should be weighed according to how it contributes to (or takes away from) your overall vision for the game. Rather than looking at things in terms of \"elegant\" or \"not elegant\", it's better to think in terms of how your change makes the player feel, why it makes them feel that way, and whether or not that feeling meshes well with your overall design.\n\nAll of your decisions should have intent. This idea extends beyond mechanic-driven games like roguelikes into all other genres of games, and even beyond games, into all other artistic mediums. If you are building a simple wooden chair, you are going to design it to be stable enough that it doesn't tip over when someone sits down in it... unless you are intentionally designing a chair that causes someone to fall down.

It still did the same damage, 1d6. Doing double damage was a popular houserule, because people enjoy the gamble. Eventually it became the official rule.\n\nUnfortunately, just like the roulette wheel at a casino, people might like it, but it's actually bad for them. Player characters are more important than mooks, and they end up taking many more attacks over the course of a campaign, so critical hits affect player characters a lot more. And a lot of PCs end up dying randomly due to them.\n\nSo, to stop PCs from dying randomly so much, patches were added on top of it. PCs get increased HP amounts. PCs (but not monsters) can fall unconscious and be resuscitated. PCs get three lives (sorry, I mean \"death saves\") before they're out. Adamantium armor makes you immune to critical damage.\n\nSome of these are good for the game, but some are really bad. Giving PCs more HP means that to balance it out, you have to either add more monsters, or give the monsters higher HP too. Whichever you do, it means that combat takes more time at the table. It grows in importance until the entire session can be combat, without much room for exploration.\n\nWhat's the real fix? Well, the problem was that critical hits are fun for players to get, but they kinda ruin the game when they kill the PCs. So just... fucking... **make critical hits a player-only ability**. Heroes get to crit, random monsters don't. \n\nYeah, it breaks the \"elegance\" that some people are weirdly fascinated by of having all entities in the world behave according to certain rules (whether pen-and-paper or computer game). That's bollocks. If you're making an adventure story, then forcing yourself to make it \"fair\" between the heroes and the mooks is... it's like making an Indiana Jones film with the constraint that Indiana Jones and Luftwaffe Mechanic #1 must get exactly the same amount of screentime. Now, if you're making a survival horror story, then sure, make the protagonists follow all the mundane rules, and have the possibility of them dying from an infected leg wound just the same as any other schmuck. But be aware of what your genre is and design accordingly. D&D was based on Fritz Leiber and Robert E. Howard stories. Go read those and find me a main character that got trench foot and died of dysentery.\n\nSo... critical hits need to exist for a purpose. And their mathematics, such as the law of large numbers, needs to be understood, and their effects on how the game will play out need to be understood. \n\n**Sil-Q** is a game in which critical hits are a very important part of the game, even more so than D&D - they're not a special-case rule, but integrated to the very core combat mechanic. Sil's critical hits interact with other parts of the system: weapon types, skills, armor, inventory weight... that's critical hits done right, not as an afterthought or \"just because\".\n\n---\n\nAs for the OP's example of miss/stumble/hit: in the image, it looks like misses will happen only around 5% of the time. This is rare enough to probably feel like a really big deal when it does happen. I wonder if that would make the player feel really bad. After all, you're calculating your action plan, but just 5% of the time it randomly fails (the plans should account for that, but realistically, players will often make plans for the 95% case and hope that it works often enough). Maybe that will fit in with a horror theme, I dunno.\n\nSo have you thought about what is the point of even having that 5%? What if you just removed it? Would players even... miss having it?\n\n>Pokemon has four types (miss, not very effective, hit, super-effective)\n\nIIRC, in Pokemon, not very/super effective are not randomized, but based on type?

I belive that's because some people clearly understand why and how ECS will work in their project, while the others clearly understand why and how ECS will NOT work in theirs, and then everyone tries to explain each other.\n\nI think it boils down on how your project is designed, but there's a catch: while you will hear how ECS was successfully applied to all kind of games, that will usually refer to real-time games. Turn-based games like roguelikes don't generally behave the same way.\n\nA warning I would give you is not to limit yourself to the E and C in ECS, but look at the S too! Often, ECS tutorials focus on entities and components, which is just a way to organize your data and avoid the diamond inheritance issue of Object-Oriented Design. But the whole thing is meant to be used paired with systems, and that's the tricky part!\n\nSystems are meant to (though not strictly forced to) act on a component for every entity that possesses it. You can write a system that updates a component of one, and one only, specific entity, but you would be going against the spirit of the ECS pattern. Also, it's hard to control the order in which entities are updated.\n\nFor example, you may have an `AI` and a `movement` systems acting on a `position` component. First, for every entity, the `AI` system chooses which direction they are moving along. Then, again for each entity, the `movement` system updates their position. What happens if two entities want to step in the same place? In a real-time game, that's not an issue: entities will move of a little delta-space in a delta-time, possibly slightly touching each other, and which moves first is unimportant. But in a turn-based game in which entities move on a grid, and often two entities cannot share the same position, moving one entity first will mean the other cannot move in the same position:\n\n* With ECS: A thinks - B thinks - A moves - B moves -> potential clashing\n* Traditional structure A thinks - A moves - B thinks - B moves -> no clashing\n\nI see two main reasons to use ECS:\n\n* structuring code: that's great, but it will work only if your game-logic naturally fit into the pattern. If you have to force it, you'll end up with a more complicated code structure.\n* performance: again, it will work only if your game-logic naturally fits into systems.

However, it definitely looks strange. I guess it looks like something else than C# to me. Anyway I'm programming a roguelike with C# and I'm pretty sure I've done floodfills and had no issues even with really massive maps.\n\nI see you're not doing recursion, which to me is the most sensible way to do floodfill. Basically this means that you have a method that \"fills\" one cell and calls itself on every neighbour, checking first that the cells fulfill any required conditions. If you want to also count the size of the area, you can add that to the same floodfill method, like this (not optimal code, I'm just trying to minimize how much I have to write):\n\n    int CalculateAreaSize(int x, int y)\n    {\n        int size = 0;\n        if (map[x, y] == floor && filled[x, y] == false)\n        {\n            filled[x, y] = true;\n            size += CalculateAreaSize(x - 1, y);\n            size += CalculateAreaSize(x + 1, y);\n            size += CalculateAreaSize(x, y - 1);\n            size += CalculateAreaSize(x, y + 1);\n            // If you want to floodfill diagonally also, add the four diagonal directions too\n        }\n        return size;\n    }\n\nInstead of separate x and y int values you could use Point, which has int x and int y. Anyway you'll start by finding a spot that's applicable (a cell that's floor and not filled in this case) and call the method with those coordinates. It'll fill the area and return the total size. You can then add it to some list where you maintain the *starting point* and size of the area, so you don't need to actually keep track of which different area every cell belongs to, like this (now with Points for clarity):\n\n    List<Pair<Point, int>> areaSizes = new List<Pair<Point, int>>();\n    Point startingPoint = .... // Where to start, maybe just pick a corner and find the first acceptable\n    int size = CalculateAreaSize(startingPoint.X, startingPoint.Y);\n    areaSizes.Add(new Pair<Point, int>(startingPoint, size);\n\nThen when every applicable cell has been filled and every area size calculated, you go through the list areaSizes and call a floodfill method on every starting point that did NOT have the largest size. One way to do it is to simply order the list with LINQ (goes like areaSizes.OrderByDescending(s => s.Second);) and then start from the second element. The floodfill method you'll need will use same kind of recursion as the area calculation, but it probably won't need to return anything. It'll just set floor to wall or whatever it is you need it to do.\n\nIf I have later time, I can try to really go through your code and figure out what exactly is making it so slow. Right now it just looks very weird to me and I'm not even getting how it works. Also, I don't have any easy access to my own roguelike code at the moment so I may remember details wrong. I hope I didn't do any major screwups with the code here.\n\nEdit - No point in gathering the different areas in one list before filling most of them, I guess. You could always just maintain the biggest one saved in a variable, and if a newly calculated area is smaller than it, fill the new area immediately.

If the unlockables are the main form of growth between playthroughs, then the game feels shallow and probably tedious because the player's just grinding to get the unlocks needed to win. \n\nSo what does this mean in terms of concrete advice? \n\n* Unlockables are great rewards. Add them if you like them. \n* Unlockables should rarely/never make the game easier. They should provide variety, either of content or mechanics. Unlocking additional \"challenge modes\" is a great and long-standing tradition. \n* The game should be interesting even if a player unlocks a minimal amount.

A lot of people seem to think that procedural generation is good because it keeps it fresh, and it's easy because you don't have to hand-craft a ton of content to get as many play-worthy hours from the game.\n\nBut if you aren't careful you end up with what this scene calls \"samey\" - which is not exactly the same, but effectively the same.  For example you walk into the room.  Yesterday the rat was on the left.  Today the rat was on the right.  But the rat will just move toward you and you will hit it and it will hit you and you will it and it will die.  And that's exactly how it will play out 100% of the time.  So who cares what shape the room was or where the pillar was or where the rat was?  It's all the same.\n\nAnd worse, it *stinks*.  Without procgen, you could have hand-crafted a cool jump-scare by scripting an encounter with four rats pouring out of cracks in the walls and ambushing the player in an especially creepy area or something.  But you didn't hand-craft, you proc-gened.  And so you ended up losing the value of hand-craft without gaining any value from proc-gen, and your game is terrible.\n\nIf you can't articulate why you want procedural generation and what some of the traps are and how you're going to work around them to create unique emergent situations, then make sure to soak up a lot of the available material before proceeding.\n\n    \nA second warning: if you're talking about Procgen without Permadeath, be careful.  The two come together for a reason.\n\nThere are *always* exceptions to any rule.  But in general, a game without permadeath is long, and its arc (whether it has a story or not) goes from the beginning to the end, and you experience the content, and then the game is over.\n\nThe arc of a roguelike is totally different.  The arc is short but you loop it over and over.  So permadeath keeps the game short, and procgen keeps it favorable to repetition.\n\nAn analogy might be that normal games are like a dungeons and dragons campaign, where roguelikes are like playing a game of magic the gathering.  In either case you might get together every tuesday night to play with a group of your friend and have fun for months on end.  But in one case it's \"one big game\" and in the other case it's \"many times around the same game but where things are always different each time.\"\n\nI think making a proc-gen game with an arc that is one long arc is an extremely tricky proposition.  There are cases where this can work (Minecraft's original survival mode is kind of like this) but I feel there's a real risk you just fall into the category of \"terrible RPG\" because you proc-gened and thus have nothing really clever, but I'm not shuffling up and playing again and again, I'm always reloading from a save and pushing forward.  With that arc, you're better to just make a real RPG imo.\n\nBest of luck with your project, whatever you decide!\n", "score": 6, "author": "savagehill"}, {"id": "diy3kv6", "body": "Look into making it so that the player can unlock new types of weapons or characters between each run.

When I look at this I don't feel like anything is particularly moving or noticeable. The stuff over the mouth looks really nice but there's almost too many layers for anyone to discern a nice flow around the face that's easy to read.\n\nI think another thing is that when you look at a face, whether it's alien or (nearly) human, your audience is going to have a certain expectation on where the eyes, nose, mouth, ears, jawline, etc...will be. I see all but the eyes clearly. There are two \"holes\" or indentations, or whatever you'd like to call them, around where the eyes should be. But intuitively I don't know which one to pay attention to, is it the bottom set of holes? Or is it the top one that's clearly under the brow line? If it's the top one something immediately feels off and that's the placement of the eyes is much too high for such a standard-form face. What I mean by that is there's enough \"human\" on this model that only the front is really changed, and all the shapes and proportions remain about the same for the rest of the model. The ears should be somewhere on the top quarter of the ears, rarely above, unless you give plenty of room for a forehead and skull and such. Of course those kinds of guidelines are always made to be broken when drawing creatures. :D\n\nOverall a really nice start. I'd say keep going! Define what kind of characteristics you really want to focus on and make sure you accent those in particular. Don't add detail just for the sake of detail. If you like  the mouth coverings like I do ( :D ), then really go all out! Remove some of the other details around that area that could distract us from it? Or maybe make it a little smoother and easy to read in order to help us see it at a first glance. And then finally, just keep up the style for the rest of the model! Creep the layered/armored/holy style around the rest of the skull, maybe change the proportions entirely for the \"brain cavity\" and send the same stuff down to the shoulders and clavicle area. \n\nI hope this has been somewhat helpful, if I was unclear on anything I'd be happy to elaborate or something.

I am being totally honest here and i think this will help your piece, if you are just looking for compliments dont read on.\n\n1) first up, the floor texture, it feels too large, if we approximate megamans height to the average human, look at his foot, one of those bits is as big as his foot, i would make it about 3 times as small or more\n\n2) edging, I would add some sort of edging to the platform, at the moment it just finishes... Think about how this platform is supported... to me this is like a bridge, so i would expect here to be a bit of a curb in there, maybe some sort of guard rail?\n\n3) Dragon Textures, I think the shoulders meld too close to the background, making it hard to read that they are actually shoulders... Either change the reflective blue texture to a differnet colour, or make it the same as the chest.\n\n4) Dragon Textures again, I feel like the green is cotton, cool if that is what your going for, but one think you need to make sure, is that its the same scale the whole way around, have a look at the tops of the wings, compared to the neck, the neck looks around the right scale, but the tips of the wings dont... edit your uvmaps by scaling different islands to get the same size the entire way around.\n\n5) Dragon textures, Same with the scales... and also i think you need to rotate them around for the chest as they are going the wrong way?I would also put a slight gloss on them, and normal map & bump map them, the start of the scale should no be displaced at all, and at the edge of the scale it should be maximum displacement... this should give a better feel to it aswell. This i think is ome of the major areas to focus on\n\n6) Dragon Horns / Claws, they feel liek they are made up of primitive shapes... i would get them looking better by adding in more geo detail.\n\n7) Background, where is megaman running to? if he defeats the dragon, where does he go?at the moemnt the background just feels out of place as its an image being composited in, not integrated into the foreground at all... you want some connecting freatures to really hook it in.\n\n8) smashed rocks, add more smaller ones, add more cuts into the larger blocks, right now the edges feel very flat, but in reality rocks have very detailed edges. Look at reference on real rocks... Also if this is a metal bridge, why is the deptn of the metal so big? This sort of metal is sheet metal?\n\nAnd yeh general notes, add more bump / normal maps (in a tasteful way), more detail, make sure uv mapping is the right scale / way.", "score": 9, "author": "candreacchio"}, {"id": "c8dx94i", "body": "Composition demands that you do something in the lower-left corner.

You got some nice feedback here already that I'll try not to repeat.\n\nWhat I will say is about the lighting:\n\nCurrently, it's pretty darn flat and does not draw my eye anywhere. Good lighting can transform pretty much any dull render into something interesting.\n\nYou say you've used 3-point lighting, but to me, it doesn't look like you know what it's good for. If it wasn't for the emissive planes reflected in his suit there, I would have never guessed that you used more than simple GI. You have not used *any* of the power 3-point lighting gives you.\n\nFirst off, pick a light source that should be more dominant than the other. The key light. This will be the main lighting of the scene, and it should come from a specific location. In this case, it could be from a few different angles: From the side, bringing out the silhouette of both Mega Man and the dragon. From the top, doing the same, but with a different feel to it. From below, giving the dragon a very dramatic look, but leaving Mega Man in shadow. \n\nWhen you're satisfied with the location and direction of the key light, having made sure that it helps make the image more readable, you can make a fill light (or several) to help bring out detail in dark areas where the single key light might not reach. In this scene, the fill light could be a soft blue glow coming from the side opposite to the key light, for example. \n\nFinally, the rim light (or back light) is what will make the shapes pop out from the background. Use it to highlight the edges of the dragon. Make it strong, perhaps even stronger than they key light. It will depend on your other lights, but a very defined rim light can look very good.\n\nRemember, the viewer will always look where there is light. The way your image is now, the entire lower left is both empty *and* well lit. 100% waste of space in its current state. Either put something there or make it dark. Or both.\n\nLight and dark areas of the image cannot and should not be defined by lighting alone. Color and value choices in textures/materials also play a huge role.\n", "score": 2, "author": "volantk"}, {"id": "c8drl0s", "body": "It may serve you well to play with the lighting a bit either with your rendering software or photoshop.

The presentation of the 3d models are good so far, but we need to be able to see more of the models. I'll just take it one asset at a time so you know where I'm going with this, but in general you'll want to show larger images. Either present larger images up front, or allow me to click on the image to bring up another page with high res versions.\n\nThe rocket launcher. You have some interesting shapes going on here, specifically the barrels and the canisters on the sides. I'd like to see those up close, and also wireframes. I'd like to see how you terminate your edges, and to see how clean the model really is. I can see some very hard edges (it seems from this size) on the canisters on the sides. Best practice on game models is to soften up hard edges on your High Poly a tad more than you think they should be, so that the normal bake is smoother. You can read about what I'm taking about [here](http://oldwiki.polycount.com/NormalMap#Edge_Thickness).\n\nPower Up Base. Really nice model. Judging by the rendered thumbnail, it looks like you've textured it, or at least thrown a normal map on there, and maybe an AO map and some simple colors. Showing the rendered image on it's own would be nice, and also larger versions of your texture sheets. I'd want to be able to judge your normal bakes to see how clean they are. Again, wires are important, the one you have on there for the low poly is too hard to see. Make your edges black instead of yellowish. I have some minor concerns about the hard edges on the parts protruding on the sides, and I'd like to see how you modeled them. If you didn't texture the item, and you just did the high poly, you are doing it right by keeping the render small. Just make sure to add a note saying what your specific task was (on both images).\n\nHelmet. Looks good, but fairly simple, which is fine. The only thing I'd like to see, again, is the wires. The only thing that's confusing, is that at first glance, the head looks like it may have been modeled by you, and not just the helmet (even though the copyright and title give it away). There are two ways of handling this that are fairly common; you can darken the bust a bit, to make the helmet stand out, or texture the helmet and leave the bust the plain gray. \n\nPokeball. Not your strongest piece. From the shots, I can see a few smoothing errors in the back and on the inside. I'd remove this piece, as it muddies up the rest of the portfolio.\n\nLaunch Tower. I'd move this up above the Helmet model as it looks superior to both the helmet and the pokeball. No need to hide it down at the bottom. Some closer views of the crane would be nice as well.\n\nHope that helps, if you have any questions, just ask.", "score": 2, "author": "BeastofChicken", "page_title": "404 Not Found"}, {"id": "cms0b7w", "body": "Thank you everyone.

For better formatting please read there, feel free to comment here though. I'm more active in responding here.)\n\nThis started off as a short morning rendering of a gear and a brick material. I like the juxtaposition of the materials, two somewhat mundane things placed against each-other in a way that's not normally seen. I intended to make the gear, and then launch myself into a Skyrim-mod binge, but the hastily-made pristine gear of brick struck an inspirational nerve, so I dived into pulling as much surrealism out of the concept as I could. Focusing primarily on composition and color balance, I spent the day setting up the grass, building and arranging the tree props, and, most importantly, striking a good balance of lighting.\n\nSince this started out as just playing with materials, I started out in Cycles, and decided to finish the piece within cycles. While I find Cycles much nicer and easier to use and compose in, I find that the eleven-hour render time it yielded for this single frame is not worth the little bit of extra thought it would have taken to get the same scene within Blender Internal renderer. I shall continue playing with Cycles, and hopefully there will soon be enough speed increases to make it more practical.\n\nComponents: Gear I used Blender's built-in Gear generator to create the gear, then used the fracture add-on to shatter the gear into ten pieces, repositioning some of the broken shards manually. Next up was adding a Bevel modifier to the broken shards of the gear. In retrospect, the bevel modifier should have been added before the fracture was made to produce a pleasant, uniform look to the gear, while manual bevels should have been added to the shards along fracture-lines to give more of a crumbled look.\n\nGrass Cycles has a wonderful built-in \"Add Quick Fur\" feature that I used to quickly generate some fur along a plane with a slight displacement modifier.\n\nTree Two models were built for the tree, the \"hero\" model and the standard model. Tree generation for both was manual. First the trunk was created as just a tall cylinder.\n\nNext a very simple branch was created. Just a long, tapered plane that was bent along the middle. I quickly applied a bevel modifier so that the 'top' of the crease wasn't sharp. A diffuse texture of a tree-branch was placed over-top of this creased-plane. One copy of this branch was kept as a 'parent' model.\n\nPine-tree branches grow in a very tight spiral, each limb shrinking a little bit relative to the last one in the chain. I made about 1440-degrees(four full-circles) worth of this tight spiral, and then duplicated and shrunk it, moving it up the tree, until I had a nice conical shape, tweaking and rotating some branches out of place for variety. Each branch was set up as a child of the initial parent branch, meaning that if I alter the parent branch, all the children get updated with it. I duplicated the tree and parent branch, and modified this new tree's parent-branch to have extra detail. Two additional 'creased planes' were added, and a simple pentagonal limb was added to the top of the branch and given the same material as the trunk. The trunk was sub-dived once from it's initial octagonal shape. This gave me a Simple and Hero tree. Fourteen Hero trees were used in the foreground; 67 Simple trees were used in the background.\n\nComposition:\n\nColor Balance As soon as I realized I was going to make a full scene to support the gear-mesh, I picked a good color scheme. I chose a red, a blue, and a green whose pure-hues looked good with one another. The red hue was pulled directly from the gear's texture, the pine-tree's trunk was altered to match this hue. It's important to do this from the start of a project, and to make sure all your diffuse textures and lights adhere to your color scheme, otherwise you get colors that clash and tear on the eye in ways that are not engaging. Because this is a night scene, I chose to keep my lamp a nice, desaturated but bright blue, but not actually use any blue within the diffuse-textures of the scene, while allowing the red and green colors to compliment each-other within the diffuse textures.\n\nPositioning I used a very simple \"rule of thirds\" layout for this, trying to lay the horizontal and vertical components of the gear along the right and bottom third-line.\n\nValue layout Again, I had assistance with laying this part of the piece out from a painter-friend. I'm still trying to work with keeping a good value distribution. To get the end effect, I set up my light so that every object could have two 'panes' of hue and that shadows would dance around the gear but not touch it. To explain the 'panes' concept, each layer of the composition (Tree, grass, brickgear, ignoring the sky) was given two 'panes', totaling six panes. Each layer's paned was mentally assigned a value. the foreground layer (gear) was the brightest value. The mid-ground layer (grass) was given a darker shade, but not completely dark, so as to frame the gear nicely, and the background layer (trees) was given the darkest value, still framing the gear but keeping it separate from the grass. Each \"layer\" was then split into two panes, to give each layer contrast within itself, so you can clearly see the edges of the gear, the grass shades itself nicely, etc. The difference between panes was handled by adjusting my sun-lamp's properties while the layers values were controlled simply through diffuse texture values through some simple node setup that allowed me to tweak the value and see it in real-time within Blender.\n\nAll this work with the panes and layers is to keep each part of the scene distinct from the other, and to emphasis the focus of the piece, as well as providing contrast within each part of the scene. \n\n", "score": 3, "author": "Krist-Silvershade"}, {"id": "ci7n7tl", "body": "Why the hell is this being downvoted?
