While not 100g the same, similar processes can be used.\n\nThey may also look at how text gets referenced by other texts. This can actually be a really important method. If you have a writer in the 200s quoting part of a Josephus text then you know Josephus's text was from at least that early.\n\nThey may also look internally at details that are right and wrong. An interesting example of this is dating the book of Daniel. Daniel claims to be written by someone in the 600s bc. However, he also puts some predictions of the future in. When you compare those predictions to actual history you find that they are fuzzy but pretty decent from about 600 to 300BC, like someone who knew the broad strokes of history. They get very good for 200BC, like someone living in those times. And then they get totally wrong for the time after 200BC (like someonenincorrectly trying to predict world affairs).

    {"subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "body": "Okay, so, right now I am somewhat inebriated. I drank a 10% ABV IPA, I do not do this regularly nor do I want to. Alcoholism is in my genes, as is addictive tendencies. I've abused weed for years, that was  my vice, I've been off of it for 25 days and I am proud of myself.\n\nBut still, it really isn't fair how MUCH better I feel after a beer. Of course, as-is the cycle, I will probably be feeling quite low again within the hour, hence I am drinking plenty of water to counteract that as well as the hangover.\n\nIt pisses me off that like... this feels like what I am missing. I remember I used to genuinely enjoy things like this sober 10 years ago. If I'm being honest, my life is objectively better than it was back then, I guess I just don't have a sense of place, I mean, I probably am depressed, but I am taking Zoloft, which is probably also emotionally blunting me a bit, like 25mg, the lowest dose before breaking a pill in half.\n\nThe thing is, I sit down and watch an anime, my favorite medium of entertainment, I am sober and it's just a \"this is okay.\" but now, I actually genuinely enjoy it. I'm in the moment, my constant and rampant self-doubt, forward thinking, etc, comparison to the past and future, the \"what ifs\" seem to always be there subconsciously, just in my passive existence. Same with music, video games, movies, literally anything. It's not that I want to feel exactly like this every time, it's just that the difference is way too stark. When I am sober, I'm just going through the motions of happiness. It's another day, 90% of things are mid.\n\nJust before I drank I was miserable, I was griping over my lack of luck on dating websites, I was whining about feeling invisible, wahhh, who cares, it's outside of me, I put all the effort I can in and it barely affected anything. But now, I feel powerful, I feel like I am supposed to feel. If I even had like... a quarter of this, I'd be content literally EVERY day. Every day I'd be grateful, I'd have enough energy to instead of constantly trying to solve my own problems, I'd be able to be more empathetic, constructively. I wouldn't waste so much time trying to solve an invisible problem of my own and instead work on trying to help other people, not begrudgingly, but because I have that much positive energy.\n\nThat's where I should be right now. Yeah, there are a few things that bother me in my own life and I've struggled to an immense degree to get to where I am now, but it makes zero sense why I'd be sad about really anything where I'm concerned. It pisses me off because my life is good, I have no right to be so miserable about things, who cares, worst case scenario they work themselves out later, who cares?\n\nI hate being so self-interested, chasing this dopamine hit my brain should just deliver me by default. I should pretty much always feel at least a quarter of this good after work. I did a good job today, I've been doing so god damned well but my brain refuses to reward me by letting me gain pleasure from the things I quite frankly, used to enjoy.\n\nIt's not even that I haven't tried all the tips, I've ground this out.\n\nI've tried new hobbies, I've changed my routes, I've helped people, I've taken breaks from the things I love, I've gotten fit, I've stayed active, I've quit weed, I've reinforced my boundaries, I've improved my sleep, I've gotten out of my comfort zone, I've done so god damned much only to feel like a 10/10 day is a 7/10 day and a 7/10 day is a 4/10 day, it's like, okay, what do you want brain? Do you want me to ALWAYS require 100% brand new novelty? I've meditated, I've engaged in esoteric spiritual practices, I've done NSDR, ASMR, read more, eaten so many frogs, what the hell man, why do I need beer or drugs to feel any sort of fucking dopamine.\n\nI feel right now, on like, one 10% IPA, like I remember I did back in 2012, that 6 month period when I was actually effortlessly happy. When I figured shit would work itself out.\n\nI've been to multiple therapists, been on multiple cocktails of medication, I've engaged in cognitive behavioral therapy, am I really that underwhelmed? Do I just find literally everything this fucking boring? I've done so god damned much, I've learned new skills, I've tried new hobbies, I've eaten countless frogs, I've done too much to be this bored by default.\n\nI think quitting the Zoloft due to its emotional blunting might help, since I felt better back then after I quit it, but honestly, I am afraid of releasing the full weight of my anxiety only to find that I'm not ready yet or that the Zoloft isn't actually the issue. If I increase the Zoloft any more, all of a sudden my nervous system starts bugging out.\n\nIt makes no sense, I don't expect to feel like this 24/7, but I am tired of feeling like crap when my brain should be like \"Hey, you did a good job today, here's some dopamine, here, feel like you rightfully should.\"\n\nIt's insufferable. I still feel the full brunt of the bad days but the good days feel so weightless, like, what's the point? Who cares?\n\n\\---\n\nThank you for your time, I know this is a ridiculous question, I'll be honest and say I'll probably feel like shit if you judge me for it. I've had no luck with therapy, tons of grifters, tons of \"just do the woik, ey dea, I can't fukkin deal with ya whinin', yer an adult man, do the fukkin work and shut up.\" or \"you just need platitudes and confidence.\"\n\nIt's not my actions that breed this, it's my brain, what the hell is wrong with this garbage heap. Why can't I be effortlessly happy when I have obviously deserved it through my actions.\n\n\\---\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIs this dull hum really all there is to dopamine when you get to be an adult regardless of literally taking the collective advice of the internet ten times over?", "title": "I'm not going to take this giga seriously, nor act on it, but I am really curious.

It makes it relatively more expensive for Americans to buy foreign products, but at the same time it makes American products cheaper and more attractive for foreign buyers.\n\nThis does not mean they need to earn \"8X\" as much profits as before.

That'll get you the worst and most desparate clients.\n\nIf you double your prices and call yourself a premium consultant then even if you're doing the exact same things, you'll generally get much better clients.  They'll generally always pay their invoices on time with no questions asked, trust that you know what you're doing, and appreciate it.  They're wealthier so they're not desperate to pinch pennies, a few thousand dollars one way or the other is just cost of doing business to them.  Not like the cheap clients for whom a few thousand might bankrupt them.\n\nDo a startup focusing on small businesses, and you'll be constantly struggling, because so are your customers.  And a lot of them are crackpots that'll constantly bicker and try anything to avoid paying, back out of a contract after you've done the work, etc.  It'll be a rare day indeed when your company gets paid in full and on time.

If the mother can afford to keep the baby, there would be less abortions (40%).\n\nWhen abortion is illegal, it just means that the rich are going to get one abroad and those who are desesperate enough are going to get one illegally, which come with higher risks and complications, like the the death of the mother (one of the leading cause of maternal mortality, 13%).\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2709326/\n\n\" Data indicate an association between unsafe abortion and restrictive abortion laws. The median rate of unsafe abortions in the 82 countries with the most restrictive abortion laws is up to 23 of 1000 women compared with 2 of 1000 in nations that allow abortions. Abortion-related deaths are more frequent in countries with more restrictive abortion laws (34 deaths per 100,000 childbirths) than in countries with less restrictive laws (1 or fewer per 100,000 childbirths).\"\n\n\"Less restrictive abortion laws do not appear to entail more abortions overall. The world\u2019s lowest abortion rates are in Europe, where abortion is legal and widely available but contraceptive use is high; in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, the rate is below 10 per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years. In contrast, in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, where abortion laws are the most restrictive and contraceptive use is lower, the rates range from the mid-20s to 39 per 1000 women\"\n\nSo yeah, making abortion illegal doesn't save babies, it just kills more mothers.\n\nAnother interesting fact: the baby bust in US.

    {"subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "body": "I am in the US. I have a friend-of-a-friend who has asked a large sum of money from me, in the $100K's, ballpark, and I am debating whether I should do it. There are of course a lot of details about this situation but just to keep the discussion relatively narrow, assume that giving this away is fine to me - I'm willing to part with the money and might even get paid back. And I believe this is a legitimate cause - I won't go into details but suppose the recipient is telling me they need it for medical treatment or for a down payment on a house or something. And there's no other way the recipient can get the money - they can't take out a loan or similar. Again, I know it's really tempting to question those details and ask me if I'm crazy to accept that, but just for the sake of keeping this discussion focused, TLDR is that I am fine giving away the money.\n\nMy question is about whether the process of giving away the money can bite me in some way. In other words I am worried about **LIABILITY** versus losing the money itself. I do not know this recipient at all, I only know my friend. I reasonably trust my friend's judgment but I accept there is tons of risk because I don't know the recipient. Again, let's just assume that despite all of this, I'm fine giving away the money - I know you're tempted to say I'm crazy to give a bunch of money to a stranger. But given this, I cannot guarantee that the recipient will use the money for the intended cause. For example, what if they're actually a drug dealer on the run from the police and use the money to buy more drugs or escape the country? Insert any other crazy scenario where my money ends up enabling something bad. Could I be liable, even if I think I'm providing the money for a legitimate cause? Note that again I am only asking for LIABILITY purposes, even if this is a Nigerian Prince scam, for the purposes of keeping this discussion contained, that's fine since I'm willing to lose the money.\n\nAlso, for tax purposes, I believe I'm exempt from any tax as long as I don't exceed the lifetime limit which is something like $12M. I'm ok eating into that - I don't expect to be donating anything close to $12M for my lifetime.\n\nAlso, I might get my money back from the recipient or friend afterward in a few months. This is not guaranteed, my donation is not contingent on this, and I don't think it changes the decision point above, but I mention it in case it changes the liability risk.\n\nThank you for any help, or if there is a better place to post this like r/finances or so then I can do that. I know again this is a nuts scenario, I am of course likely to say No, but I am interested in the risk of liability part.\n\nEDIT: Before I give this money away, I will consult a lawyer.

This is why you're asking for advice from strangers on the internet rather than consulting a lawyer.  The Lawyer would tell you \"hell no\", whereas the advice here is saying \"go see a lawyer\".\n\nLet's say your friends friend is actually a terrorist (domestic or otherwise), then anything they do with that money, you are partially liable for.  Sounds extreme, but it's supposed to.  You are vague on the details as to how the money will be used and therefore anything is possible.\n\nIt's one thing to be foolish and be out of money, it's another to be responsible for funding a terrorist organization and end up in federal prison with all your assets seized.\n\nEven if your friend has 100% honorable intentions, the fact is that seeing a lawyer and having a contract drawn up not only protects you, it protects your friend from liabilities too.

    {"subreddit": "NoStupidQuestions", "body": "And yes I fully expect to get some downvotes here\n\nI understand it works both ways. As someone who has been vegetarian since age 5, I've long found it dubious that vegan diets really are going to be nearly as nutritional as a more natural omnivore or pescetarian-based diet\n\nI see that anti-vegan-diet backlash has been taking a little more root recently and last night I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpxgZGnEF7E) video which is presumably doing the rounds.\n\nNow I've long been a supporter of environmentalist, sustainability, animal welfare causes. The latter was the primary reason for me going vegetarian at such a young age. \n\nThe main problem I find here is bias. Proponents of a vegan diet maintain that any claims about meat or animal products being essential are in the pocket of the animal agriculture industry. Conversely, plenty of studies which suggest a vegan diet is perfectly fine are often linked to people with a vested interst in the vegan movement.\n\nHonestly? As much as I agree with the cause, I've long been skeptical about a vegan diet. My no. 1 reason is, as little as we understand about nutrition, we've proved that processed foods are bad time and time again. There's also the fact that many essential nutrients found in plants aren't absorbed well by the body, the same is true for supplements. I do enjoy eating fake meat because it tastes good to me and because quite frankly I don't want to eat meat but I doubt it's going to be healthy and I thnink real meat probably does have much greater macronutrients and at the end of the day, health benefits.\n\nA lot of people who follow the diet would probably decide to follow the diet even in the face of proof that is detrimental, or less healthy, to human beings, and I applaud that dedication to the cause but I just can't get my head around that; at the end of the day I want to look out for number 1 and that's just how I feel.\n\nDo other people share these concerns and is there any way I can found more discussion on the matter which is totally free of bias and vested interests?\n\n**Edit: reddit is one place where I overwhelmingly see pro-vegan diet support and discussion but I can't help but feel it's representative of the optimistic liberal mindset of younger generations and the social media zeitgeist of the last couple decades. My overwhelming feeliing is, jsut because we want the diet to be just as healthy in principle, doesn't make it so. I'm very open to the 'uncomfortable truth' that a purely vegan or plant-based diet simply doesn't provide all of the nutrients a human needs to be truly healthy**", "title": "Do you think there is tons of misinformation online surrounding the healthfulness of vegan diets due to propaganda?", "id": "138kypd", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/138kypd/do_you_think_there_is_tons_of_misinformation/", "permalink": "/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/138kypd/do_you_think_there_is_tons_of_misinformation/", "author": "TossThisItem", "comments": [{"id": "jj0575a", "body": "Here\u2019s the thing, humans are omnivores and evolved to be able to survive on a wide range of dietary inputs.

However, \u201cdoing it right \u201d requires a lot more effort and dedication so the only people who will succeed are the hardcore acolytes. The same for carnivore diets. Vegetables have nutrients you need and modern supplements may not cut it. You likely wont die but it might cause issues. Vegetarian diets are pretty low risk and don\u2019t require the intense dedication of veganism. You get protein from byproducts and plenty of vegetables. Your basic omnivore diet is probably superior because it gives you the easiest access to every nutrient type.\n\nI will say that the extremes, such as veganism or carnivore, are only really able to exist due to modern societal wealth, oil production, large complex logistic chains etc. Veganism\u2019s need to extend outside of food into things like refusing to use wool, leather, etc is only possible because there are crude oil based substitutes that can fill that role.

What works for someone will not necessarily work for someone else.\n\nNot one diet is healthier than the other, just different. In general, it's always advised to have a well-balanced diet in order to consume a wide array of macro and micro nutrients, but that's about the end-all be-all of nutrition where everyone agrees.\n\nFrom personal experience, the vegan diet didn't work out for me. I did it first for moral reasons, then to \"eat healthier\". Me and two other people I know were following the same eating habits with varying levels of physical activity. I lost an absurd and dangerous amount of weight in a short period of time, another person started losing their hair while maintaining the same weight, while another saw no difference whatsoever to their physical and mental health/appearance. We all eventually dropped the diet due to affordability (eating more food in comparison to an omnivore diet), lack of positive results (over a year of consistency), and getting incredibly bored of the food items.\n\nThere is unfortunately no number 1 diet. We simply lack the necessary knowledge and circumstances to copy-paste the same nutritional standard on everyone.

They're full of liquid called vitreous humor and coated in liquid tears. If you slept with your eyes open, they'd dry out, which would cause itchiness and irritation at best and could permanently distort your vision and damage your eyes at worst. The eyes' shape is vital to their functioning and if they get deformed (think like a grape becoming a raisin), the eye won't be able to focus properly when you wake up. Even on a micro level, the eye needs to be moist so it'll be lubricated to roll around without friction. Also has to be smooth so light doesn't warp traveling through it in a way the eye can't focus (like frosted glass blurs light that comes through it--it isn't a smooth surface). It's why we blink when we're awake. Blinking also removes debris and shed cells from the cornea as the eyelid consistently acts as a windshield wiper of sorts, pushing tears across the surface of the eye and getting the gross stuff out.\n\nIn short, raisin-ing your eyeballs while asleep and not letting them constantly flush out dust and excess environmental gunk won't make your eyes very good at doing the vision thing when you wake back up.\n\nBonus fun fact, our corneas (the outermost surface of our eyes) are avascular--they don't have their own blood supply to get oxygen from.

You're falling down a potentially dangerous rabbit hole on the internet, and that doesn't end anywhere good. I'm not saying don't read it, but make sure you're reading it very critically and fact-checking what you read. You're doing the right thing by asking.\n\nHere's the truth underlying the myth:\n\nWomen tend to approach relationships differently than men do, but it's for social reasons, not biological ones. Men are the number one danger to women. Most women who will experience violence in their lifetime will experience it at the hands of a male romantic partner. And every woman who was ever killed, beaten, or raped by an intimate partner thought that he loved her and she loved him. So there's a certain caution to the way most women experience romantic love that most men don't experience. Also, the most important way for a woman to avoid becoming a victim of this kind of violence is to be financially secure. Domestic violence rates are tied to income level and financial stress. Furthermore, a lot of the personal traits that have been identified as risk factors for becoming a domestic abuser are also traits that might impact career success, such as a history of aggressive or criminal behavior, drug/alcohol addiction, impulsiveness, and antisocial personality traits. That's not to say that professionally successful men can't be domestic abusers, or that poor/addicted men are destined to become domestic abusers, but there's a correlation there that many women are aware of (even if just intuitively). \n\nMen also have more of an economic impact on the lives of women than the other way around. For example, women tend to be professionally penalized for getting married and having children, but men tend to be rewarded for it. Look up \"motherhood penalty and fatherhood bonus,\" as well as the \"marriage bonus\" for men, which does not exist for women. In fact, at ages where women are most likely to marry (mid to late 20s), single women make 10-20% more, and delaying marriage has a huge effect on women's lifetime earnings. That is to say, getting married and having children is going to be a significant financial hit to a woman. So of course many women are going to be concerned about making sure they choose a partner who can offset that penalty, and that their partner continues to offset that penalty throughout the course of the relationship. \n\n[Getting married also increases a woman's housework burden](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-018-0647-x), regardless of how many children they have. Married women do significantly more housework than single women, even if both women have the same number of children. And interestingly, much of the effect is down to marriage itself, as even unmarried women who simply live with a male partner do less housework than married women (though still more than single women). And even when studied the other way around (looking at husbands vs. live-in boyfriends), [married men do less housework](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070827174300.htm). \n\nAll this to say: Male partners are a huge risk to women's lives, safety, finances, and free time. So yes, most women are pretty concerned with making sure they marry men who come with lower risks. To men who don't understand this dynamic, I can see how it might look like women only care about what a man can give them. But what's actually going on is that women care about making sure a man is worth those risks, or that he can offset those risks somehow.", "score": 4, "author": "eldestdaughtersunion", "page_title": "Page Unavailable | SpringerLink"}, {"id": "jj04akd", "body": "as a girl who doesnt want kids, yes! i believe there are very very few differences in how a woman and man think besides how they were raised, so any good woman would love a man for who they are just as a man would love a woman for who they are", "score": 3, "author": "honodono"}, {"id": "jj0612f", "body": "What you read is bullshit. \n\nAnd also the premise of all men loving a woman no matter what, as you have implied, is also bullshit.", "score": 2, "author": "ByeByeMan666"}, {"id": "jj077zp", "body": "It it even possible for one man to love a woman the way another man does?

Maybe people here will think I\u2019m dumb for even considering this, but I just want to know and see if these are real signs. I just want to help him. \n\n1. He always tries to be extremely manly. I have dated very manly men in the past, but this just feels weird. If he goes to the gym, he wants to get all bulky and big and when I ask him why he responds with \u201cbecause it\u2019s manly and other men will take me seriously\u201d. When he feels emotional and I say it\u2019s ok to share your feelings.. his response: \u201cNo that\u2019s not manly\u201d. Same with other things. His respond always has to do with masculinity. It is like he is trying so hard to be manly, while he\u2019s not. The only two explanations I have is: (I think) he grew up with people calling him feminine because of his high-pitched voice OR he wants to be a girl (see my other points below)\n\n2. I love putting make-up on him, but just between us two and in the house. The first time I put make-up on him (full face look), he was staring at himself in the mirror and said that he looked \u201cso good\u201d. And I asked him If should we go outside and he said yes (it was dark that night but the face that he immediately said Yes\u2026). The second time he was a bit more reserved, I think because he taught that it\u2019s not ok to like it, and when I put it on he said put the mirror away. But I didn\u2019t and he was in awe and said he looked like a doll. I then looked at him and called him pretty and gorgeous and he liked it. He then told me that he once went to a company (he is in sales) and that company was selling make-up for men. He was waiting for my response and I told him that\u2019s ok and normal, he said noooo that\u2019s so gay blabla. It\u2019s like he wanted my validation/confirmation. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know If this is even a thing for trans people (sorry If it\u2019s not), but he wants me to f*K him with a dildo (pegging) every once in a while and he also likes nipple play. He also likes being dominated from time to time. \n\nIn daily life and at home, he is very \u201cmasculine\u201d: plays and watches sports, hangs out with a lot of guy friends, likes to look good (male fashion), is pretty hairy and likes it that way, enjoys competitive things, dominates me most of the time in bed, loves bbq and outdoor stuff.. but he is also a very soft and softspoken person. He also edits his pictures (Photoshop) and looks at himself every second in every mirror. \n\nI feel as if he is trying very hard to be manly, but I dont know If that is because of his insecurities in the past or If he really wants to be a Girl. He is also very religious so I don\u2019t think I could ever bring it up directly. I don\u2019t think he is gay because he is very much attracted to me and my body. \n\n[excuse my spelling english isn\u2019t my first language]", "title": "Is my bf trans?", "id": "138gckq", "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/138gckq/is_my_bf_trans/", "permalink": "/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/138gckq/is_my_bf_trans/", "author": "yassrn29", "comments": [{"id": "jiy0115", "body": "It is very hard for an outsider to make an assumption.

Toxic masculinity is a hell of a drug, and it definitely seems like he's overcompensating, but there's no way external to be sure what is driving that. It could be as simple as him liking anal sex and wildly overthinking possible implications. Or it could be body dysmorphia\u2014way more men have body-image issues than most people realize.\n\nA couple other things to consider: you're vulnerable to confirmation bias. That's not a personal judgement; I don't know you from anyone, but we're all vulnerable to having a belief and subconsciously cherry picking proof for it. It's easy to build an image of someone out of assumptions and unintentionally push that false images onto them.\n\nAlso, there's the question of what to do if you knew she was trans. Like, would you push her to tell you? Because that could backfire. She's clearly very focused on being masculine, and triggering her anxieties around gender will likely cause her to go full on into her unhealthy coping mechanisms. \n\nSo I think the best approach is to try to step away from any assumption of gender.  Make it clear that you don't care about him being masculine or feminine or whatever. Offering to let him experiment with gender is a good call, like what you did with make-up.

Kepler\u00b4s horoscopes promised him to acquire wealth and fame while serving in military. So Wallenstein commited. He rose through the ranks of imperial army despite the fact that he was not really good tactician or militarily skilled. He was good organizer and ensure that he always had the larger army than his opponents. He slowly but steadily rose through the ranks. He also made good impression on the emperor and some people around him. When the protestant rebels lost their estates and riches, Wallenstein was one of the biggest recievers of them. \n\nThen emperor decided, that some form of monetary reform might be necessary. And quite suprisingly, Wallenstein was one of the 5 people who secretly agreed to take control of it (secretly in a way that it wasnt public knowledge). The coins they minted had much lower amount of silver. Now, some of the other \"protestant/anti-emperor\" rebels had to pay a quite substantial fines. And to be able to pay them, they had to sell some of their properties. And the only coins they could get for their properties were these low-quality coins that Wallenstein was behind. These low quality coins of course didnt have the proper value, meaning that the rebels had to sell even more of their property for these shitty coins and Wallenstein was getting infinitely richer. The whole thing ended with state-declared bankruptcy with Wallenstein becaming one of the richest and most influential nobles in the whole HRE. \n\nBut here his life gets really interesting. Because he was very confident, arrogant, spiteful and inflammatory. So he got himself quite a few enemies. And some of them conspiried against him and basically forced emperor to release him from the army. However, in the same time Sweden entered Thirty Years War. And Wallenstein replacements were continously failing. So emperor begged Wallenstein to come back. He became the generalissimus of the newly formed Imperial Army, largest army that HRE assembled. He had nearly unlimited command of the army as a whole. \n\nThe entirety of what happened at the end of his life is very hard to explain shortly, because its super complicated. But his spitefulness took over and he refused to help people that spoke against him to emperor with his army and just let Swedes to plunder their lands. He also entered talks with emperors enemies and potentionally was thinking about switching sides. Its necessary to say that in this period of his life, neurosyphilis he was suffering from took over much of his decision making. He suffered from delusions of grandiuer, dreaming about being crowned a king of Bohemia and making Europe-wide crusade that would push Ottomans from Europe completely. People around emperor got nervous and started to talk against him again. And emperor listened again.

She talks about how you need to figure out why exactly you're scared of dying. I would highly recommend watching that. As far as I can remember the main reasons are\n\n1. Being worried about the pain caused to friends or loved ones. \n\n2. Being worried about what might happen to you if it turns out there is an afterlife. \n\n3. Being worried that the process of dying might be painful. \n\n4. Being worried that you won't get to do or experience the things that you want to. \n\n5. Being worried that your projects or goals will end with your death.\n\n6. Being worried about what will happen to anyone who depends on you. \n\nThe way she recommends tackling these is the following: \n\n1. Read some grief memoirs and learn how resilient people can be. \n\n2. Talk to a religious leader who has a more loving and gentle interpretation of whatever religion you follow / are most closely aligned with. \n\n3. Getting living wills and medical power of attorney in order so that you have control over your dying process. also checking to see if there are dignity and choices laws where you live that allow you to take life-ending medication in the event that you receive a terminal diagnosis and are in pain. \n\n4. Make it a habit to do what you want to do now rather than later, or at least some of what you want to do. Like if your dream is to travel the world as a photographer and you can't afford that yet, take a class and start taking pictures of the local attractions near where you live. \n\n5. Set up any trusts or continuity plans so that any project you're involved in that you want to continue after you're gone is taken over by someone you trust.\n\n6. Make sure you have life insurance set up properly as well as guardianship arrangements for anyone you're responsible for. Your friend it seems to be young and probably doesn't have that issue but it's good to know about.", "score": 1, "author": "SuperHotelWorker"}]}
