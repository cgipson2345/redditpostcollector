In your shoes I would probably aim to get ~760-780 in math and then start working on reading and grammar. Figure out what's losing you on math (e.g. for me it was not knowing a lot of rules because of the pandemic and pre calculus) and learn them.

There's a load of different strategies so choose which one is best for you.\n- Improve your reading speed and comprehension. This is very difficult to improve in a short time and is the reason why practicing for the SAT reading section is the hardest out of all three. Consider reading news articles online daily fast while also maintaining full comprehension.\n- Practice. This is the best and fastest way to improve your SAT reading section. Crank out one passage at a time so you learn the content at hand and the question format. After each passage (don't do full reading sections at once) double back and look at what you got wrong.

It says when product price is 60 we get 0 products sold (y-intercept) and for every decrease in 1.5 we get a product sold.\n\nWe already got one point which is the y-intercept (0,60) and the slope should just be -1.5. To confirm we can say okay when we set price to 58.5 we get one product sold, so (1, 58.5). Put that with y-intercept to find slope and you'll get -1.5.\n\nThat leaves us with this equation:\n\ny= -1.5x+60\n\nNow, its says when revenue is 262.5 what is the number of products sold? It's given that revenue = price x products sold\n\nSo, revenue = xy\n\nxy=262.5\n\nThis is a system of linear equations. We need values of x and y to satisfy both equations. Fastest way to do this is to use desmos (or a graphing calculator). We write both equations and we get 2 intersection points:\n\n(5,52.5) and (35, 7.5). Since 5 isn't an answer choice and the phrase \"could be the number of products sold\" implies that there might be more than one answer, leads us to the conclusion that 35 is the answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswer is D", "score": 2, "author": "zZzRandzZz"}]},

Unfortunately, i don't have a picture so i will write it here:\n\nvalues of f(x)+2 are shown below \nx: 18, 22, 26\ny: -52, 12, -52\n\nif f(x) is a quadratic function, find the y value of the y-intercept of f(x)", "title": "Question from March DSAT, math", "id": "138b0wp", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/138b0wp/question_from_march_dsat_math/", "permalink": "/r/Sat/comments/138b0wp/question_from_march_dsat_math/", "author": "nickiminajputhy", "comments": [{"id": "jiy0t8q", "body": "Okay so disclaimer I\u2019m not sure if this is correct or not but this is what I came up with:\n\nf(x) is a quadratic so that means it has a vertex. From the information given we can make a coordinate plane and plot 3 points. \n\nFrom the rough sketch we can see that the vertex point of f(x)+2 is (22,12) and this parabola is downward facing, so that is its maximum value.\n\nWe want to find f(x) so we shift the graph 2 units down to counteract the +2. This gives us the vertex point of f(x) which is (22,10)\n\nWe now can use the vertex form of quadratic to try to make our function.\n\nf(x)= a(x-h)^2 + k\n\nwhere a,h,k are constants (h,k) is the vertex, and a is how open the parabola is.\n\nf(x)= a(x-22)^2 + 10\n\nWe now need to find \u201ca\u201d. Luckily we have lots of points to use to find \u201ca\u201d (do not use the vertex point this will not work). Let\u2019s input (18,-54) remember we shifted the parabola down 2 units. This is why its -54 instead of -52.\n\n-54 = a(18-22)^2 + 10\n\n-54 = 16a + 10\n\n-64 = 16a\n\na = -4\n\nThis is perfect because our parabola is downward, therefore \u201ca\u201d has to be negative.\n\nFinally we get our final vertex form:\n\nf(x)= -4(x-22)^2 + 10\n\nLet\u2019s now find the y-intercept. To do this we make \nx = 0.\n\nf(0) = -4(-22)^2 + 10\n\nf(0) = -1,926\n\nThe reason it is a high negative number is because the parabola is going downwards, and due to the openness of the parabola it takes a while until it touches the y-axis.\n\nAnswer is -1926\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong", "score": 3, "author": "zZzRandzZz"}, {"id": "jixcvbb", "body": "Reminder: When asking for help with questions from tests or books, please include the source of the question in the post title.

I noticed in your replies to other commenters saying you have bad test anxiety. If you are able to get a 504 or an IEP plan at school, you could maybe qualify for accommodations giving you extra time on the SAT. To get a 504 or an IEP plan you need official diagnosis results for your mental health issues, but it varies depending on the school. So eventually, when you get a plan of some sort, your counselor would have to submit a request for accommodations for College Board exams, and you would either get 1.5x extra time or 2x extra time! You also test in another room with a smaller group of people so it might be helpful!\n\nI got 1450 on the November SAT, and I just want to say if you've tried everything, I would recommend familiarizing yourself with basic grammar rules. I'm in my school's journalism program and I'm constantly editing articles, so that's how I was able to get myself used to grammar rules.\n\nFor the math section, I would suggest first getting yourself a strong grasp on the foundations of math. We all need refreshers in math topics after we haven't done them in a while so start small. I think you should start with the basics of algebra, work up to geometry, then to trigonometry. Khan Academy and The Organic Chemistry Tutor(YouTuber who uploads STEM content) are very good resources for math.\n\nIf none of these work, I would also suggest you think about taking the ACT! it varies from person to person, but for some people, the SAT is not their thing but the ACT is, and vice versa. People around me who have taken both say that the ACT tends to be easier than the SAT, but the times are shorter.\n\nAdding on: For the writing section, something that has REALLY helped me was doing the easier questions first, like the definition questions that ask you to choose a synonym for a word in the passage. NEVER do the first question first because usually those questions are about the main ideas of the passage and require more thinking.", "score": 1, "author": "Glum_Cranberry5124"}]},

If you're getting a lot of questions wrong due to something simple that you haven't learned yet (for example, comma rules), you could probably boost your score significantly in a few hours just by learning that one thing. Similarly, if you got a lot of questions wrong your first time because you weren't very familiar with the test format, simply taking a few practice tests could make a huge difference. However, if you're getting most of your questions wrong due to something like vocab, it could literally take hundreds of hours to see the same progress. Since you just have a few days I would suggest starting with the areas where it is possible to make the fastest progress.\n\n  \nI've been teaching SAT for about 15 years, and I've started making videos covering key strategies and concepts for the new Digital SAT. I've only managed to get a few up so far, but I think you may find them helpful, especially if you don't already have a strong approach for attacking each question type. Here's my latest, which provides 3 simple steps you can use to ace vocab-in-context questions, even when you don't know all the words:\u00a0[https://youtu.be/dFQaoOGYhTk](https://youtu.be/dFQaoOGYhTk)\n\nThis one on research note questions could also be a big time saver: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo7LFbac\\_9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo7LFbac_9o)\n\n  \nOf course, the best practice is taking all the official tests released by the College Board. If you haven't taken all four already, you should take them. You may also try to supplement the official tests with practice tests from a book, but if you do so, keep in mind that they will probably be full of unrealistic and/or flawed questions, so don't panic if their answer justifications don't make a lot of sense.\u00a0\n\n  \nAnother thing to keep in mind is that taking all the practice tests in the world won't help much if you don't review them thoroughly. And when you review, you should focus less on why a\u00a0particular\u00a0answer is right or wrong than on what caused you to get a particular question wrong and how you can avoid getting similar questions wrong in the future. Did you get a question wrong because you didn't know a punctuation rule? Then learn your punctuation rules! Did you get a question wrong because you misunderstood the question? Then ask yourself what caused you to\u00a0misunderstand the question. If it was because you didn't know a key word, take steps to improve your vocab. If it was because you simply didn't read it carefully enough, focus on developing your concentration and time management skills.\u00a0\n\n  \nGood luck!", "score": 4, "author": "hellonathanteacher", "page_title": "Digital SAT Reading & Writing Lesson #2: Vocab-in-Context Questions - YouTube"}, {"id": "jiqhi5h", "body": "try to solve vocab ques first, grammar, graphs, and others. lemme know again after the practice test.", "score": 2, "author": "Busy_Refuse_5822"}]},

After this you'll probably be waiting in a common area before heading into an exam room, before going to the exam room they will once again check your credentials and give you your exam room number. It might be different for each test centre but more a less the same, once you're inside the exam room they will give you instructions such as how to go ahead, you can take out your devices and place them on the table, they also give you plain paper where they ask you to write down your name, they do not review this it is only for preventing questions leaks. You can use a pencil or a pen on this paper that is completely up to you and you can use your calculator for both the math sections just in case you don't like desmos. They will give you wifi details to connect and then ask you to open the bluebook app and before you start the test they have another test code that you enter on your device and then you get started, now be aware that your timer starts as soon as the first question on your screen appears, you will be familiar that you can hide this feature however if you feel to anxious. Anyways, it's a smooth journey after just go ahead and give your best, once you've reached the break you can use all of the 10 minutes, depending on the test centre they might allow you to exit the exam room but then its up to you since the break timer will be counting down.

How quickly you can boost your score depends on why you are currently losing points. If you're getting a lot of questions wrong due to something simple that you haven't learned yet (for example, comma rules), you could probably boost your score by over a hundred points in a few hours just by learning that one thing. Similarly, if you got a lot of questions wrong your first time because you weren't very familiar with the test format, simply taking a few practice tests could make a huge difference. However, if you're getting most of your questions wrong due to something like vocab, it could literally take hundreds of hours to see the same progress. Since your time is limited, I would suggest starting with the areas where it is possible to make the fastest progress, like mastering punctuation rules and math formulas, as well as developing strategies to attack specific question types.\u00a0\n\n  \nI've been teaching SAT for about 15 years, and I've started making videos covering key strategies and concepts for the new Digital SAT. I've only managed to get a few up so far, but I think you may find them helpful, especially if you don't already have a strong approach for attacking each question type. Here's my latest, which provides 3 simple steps you can use to ace vocab-in-context questions, even when you don't know all the words:\u00a0[https://youtu.be/dFQaoOGYhTk](https://youtu.be/dFQaoOGYhTk)\n\n  \nBeyond that, of course there is Khan Academy. And in terms of paid resources, I would highly recommend Erica Meltzer's books. She recently released beta versions adapted for the digital SAT, and although I haven't gotten my hands on copies yet, I'm sure they'll be worth the 30 bucks or whatever it is that she's charging. I don't generally recommend textbooks because I've found they're nearly always trash (Barons, Kaplan, Princeton Review, McGraw Hill), but I use hers with literally all of my students.\u00a0\n\n  \nOf course, the best practice is taking all the official tests released by the College Board. Because there are only 4, however, you may want to ration them. You may also try to supplement the official tests with practice tests from a book, but if you do so, keep in mind that they will probably be full of unrealistic and/or flawed questions, so don't panic if their answer justifications don't make a lot of sense.\u00a0\n\n  \nAnother thing to keep in mind is that taking all the practice tests in the world won't help much if you don't review them thoroughly. And when you review, you should focus less on why a\u00a0particular\u00a0answer is right or wrong than on what caused you to get a particular question wrong and how you can avoid getting similar questions wrong in the future.

Red = hard, yellow = middle, green = easy.\n\n|**Sorted by**|**April 12**|**April 25**|**All Time Hardest**|**All Time Easiest**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|[Reading Difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/6A1OrR3.png)|28th|21st|November '19|June '19|\n|[Writing Difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/hZYIQtz.png)|30th|21st|December '19 Int|June '19|\n|[No-calc Difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/sbGGqB9.png)|8th|13th|June '22|August '19|\n|[Calc Difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/12ZMvE7.png)|22nd|8th|October '22 US|October '19 Int|\n|[Overall Difficulty](https://i.imgur.com/sMn9VMU.png)|20th|12th|March '23 Int|Oct '22 School|\n\n# Best of luck to everyone who took these exams!", "title": "April 2023 SAT Difficulty Ratings", "id": "1311v9l", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/1311v9l/april_2023_sat_difficulty_ratings/", "permalink": "/r/Sat/comments/1311v9l/april_2023_sat_difficulty_ratings/", "author": "Donald_Keyman", "comments": [{"id": "jhz3fni", "body": "Once again, these are opinions on \u201cdifficulty\u201d and mean nothing about scoring.

After the first test date for the current SAT in March 2016, scores were held until *after* the next test date in May that year. I suspect CB will do something similar here. \n\nWhy? Well, I'm no insider, but I surmise that CB had no real-world score data against which it could compare student performance on that first test in March 2016, so CB waited until it had data from another test\u2014two months later\u2014for comparison. So, I would not be surprised if scores are held until some time in May. \n\nIncidentally, CB used to do a pretty thorough job with test development on the previous SAT, i.e., the test in use from 2005 to 2015. There were 10 sections total, and one of these sections would be experimental. The student would know that the first and last sections were never experimental, but could only guess which of the remaining eight sections was\u2014and only then because an extra section (for reading, math, or grammar) was given. Then, when test results were released, the student would find out which section was not scored. The situation since 2016 has been far less \"controlled,\" to put it euphemistically, but let's not get into that. \n\nWhy does this matter? Well, I suspect CB is trying to do a better job at creating a viable test prior to its roll-out in the US. This means that international students are unfortunately being used as guinea pigs, and that US 10th graders will soon follow suit. Presumably after a year's worth of test administrations, CB will have a test that is more or less usable. \n\nThis says nothing about the quality of the test itself, and from my perusal of the tests currently available, the verbal sections are pathetically easy\u2014at least in comparison to the current test, and certainly in comparison to the 2005-2015 test.  I really cannot see what CB hopes to accomplish with this test revision, but I suspect it may be a flop, and that the colleges that still require standardized test scores may likely opt for the ACT over the SAT in coming years.", "score": 2, "author": "D_Es_C_H"}, {"id": "jhpet6b", "body": "What are the same statements they tell you?", "score": 1, "author": "RichInPitt"}]},

Then go back to the passages and find the points where the question references specific line numbers and answer those questions (in your head or flip to write them down in the book directly). Then read the passage gradually and then go answer the questions. Ideally you never flip back to the passage.\n\nAs for content, it\u2019s just reading comprehension so I can\u2019t really teach you that. Try to care and be really enthusiastic about the passage, teach it to yourself in your head, wonder about it, ask yourself questions, annotate, draw smiley/frowny faces, whatever.

There is a BEST answer for each question and three WRONG/WORSE answers for each questions and there is definite proof in the passage that leads to that conclusion. If it doesn\u2019t exist in the passage, it never happened.\n\nWriting section: learn grammar rules, and be fast. Remember there\u2019s only one right answer. And shorter/clearer/more concise is usually right.\n\nMost important grammar rule for me is that grouping signs:\n\u2014, (), [], {}, \u201c\u201d, \u2018\u2019 MUST APPEAR IN PAIRS.

Just English and Maths? No other subjects?\n\nYup\n\n>And according to my research SATs are for grade 11 (the highest grade in highschool, right?) I'm currently form 4 in my country which should be grade 10 in the US. The SAT is supposed to be the test that gets you into college and unis right? Sorry if this might sound rude, but the practice test seemed a little.. too easy? Am I missing something?\n\nI suppose the SAT's aren't **for** a certain grade (any grade can take them), but it is probably most commonly taken by 11th graders which would be people in their 3rd year of high school. In the US, high schools would go upto 12th grade so they would have one more year left.\n\nThe SAT isn't like an entrance exam (it's not like JEE for india or gao kao for china - if you're familiar with those). It is a test that checks ur understanding of basic high school level math and high school level reading. It is merely a data point in the college admissions process. It isn't the case where (at least for the majority, if not all of the schools) if you get a 1550+, you get into this school automatically, if you get a 1470+, you get into that school. But yes, if you've got a good high school education and are an active reader, you would likely find the SAT to be fairly \"easy\".\n\n>The reading writing section didn't even have a writing section, it was all objectives.. I'm missing something aren't I?\n\nWhat is commonly referred to as the writing section isn't actually a \"writing section\" where you physically write stuff for grading. There used to be a thing called the SAT essay but that was discontinued a few years ago. When taking the test, you shouldv'e noticed two different types of questions. The first half should have been of questions where you are checked for the understanding of the passage (main idea, theme, opposing viewpoints etc). The other half shouldv'e been the testing of your \"writing skills\" where you shouldv'e been asked about grammar, syntax, sentence structure, disction etc. This second half is what most refer to as the \"writing\" section.\n\nBut to get a good idea of your starting score, I would sit down and take the test and try as much as you would on a real test.", "score": 2, "author": "asianmaleincs"}, {"id": "jhkjrd6", "body": "Bluebook means digital SAT, correct?\n\nYou will have 32 minutes for each Writing module and 35 minutes for each Math module.

Less than 0.1% of students score the minimum or maximum score, so it\u2019s accomplishing the goal.\n\nit\u2019s not \u201ca test that gets you into uni\u201d.

Don\u2019t buy books and don\u2019t read them, they\u2019re analog and too slow and you don\u2019t have that time. Just grind Khan Academy until it gets annoying. Grind it all out. Then grind some more. I\u2019ve done thousands of Khan questions and if you aren\u2019t seeing repeats you aren\u2019t trying. \n\nIf you get to this goal of fully knowing all the SAT content then you should be scoring 1300-1400 minimum on Khan practice tests depending on the quantity of accuracy and method mistakes you make.\n\nSkip questions that you can\u2019t see the solution process for within 5-30 seconds. When you\u2019ve actually practiced the SAT about 90% of questions should take 1-5 seconds for you to understand the solution process for, because you\u2019ve seen so many of them.\n\nYou go through each section twice at minimum. \nOne faster first pass, keeping the momentum and flow of you only spending time on the questions you know you can break.\nThen do a 1.5th (?) pass to answer the questions that you skipped the first time.\nYour second pass is starting from the beginning of the section and going top to bottom reviewing your work and visiting the hard questions and double checking the early ones for \u201cstupid mistakes.\u201d\nEvery pass after that should be an increasingly granular and slow and focused check on potential problem questions after you are 99% sure on 99% of the questions.\n\nSkip paragraphs of irrelevant information. This is a test, not a novel. Go to the part with the question mark and answer it.\nCircle your best guess in the book and start transferring written answers to bubbles in the answer booklet when you have 2-3 minutes left.\n\nI\u2019d say a normal pace for the math section is 30min/80min total. No-calc should take 10 minutes first pass and calculator should take 20m first pass (this is very possible, but a high target). You have leeway on the calculator section, so you can take your time to make sure your first pass there is 99% accurate. You do not have leeway on the no-calculator section. The spare time in each section is used to ensure perfect accuracy. \n\nDouble check the questions, especially the hard ones. And then check the easy ones, because those are sometimes the hardest.\n\nFor pacing on the reading, try 10-12 minutes per passage which should give you ample time to check your work. The secret is to check your work. You will never get it perfect the first try. You submitting a first try unchecked SAT is you essentially giving up a bunch of points because you wasted your time.\n\nYes you don\u2019t need to be PERFECT, you\u2019re aiming for 1200+, but are you going to be happier if your score is 1300 or 1000? Exactly. Err on the side of the higher score even if it means putting your head down and doing some very hard work the next two weeks. But all of this is what you\u2019re aiming for, an ideal. It\u2019s okay if your study or practice tests don\u2019t meet it.\n\nWriting is easy. \n\nDo NOT study for the SAT after 6:00 PM May 5th, that will not increase your score but only decrease it.

My mom called me multiple times and my brother was in the next room, watching youtube. I was distracted and I had just come home after 10 hours of school.  \nAfter a day's gap, I attempted both the math modules on 17th, with similar conditions.  \n\n\nThe scenario is similar for Practice 2.  \n\n\nHowever, for practice 3, I got a good night's sleep the day before the test, did some exercise in the morning, got some sunlight, and was mentally prepared for the test.\n\nI told my mom in advance, locked my doors and minimized the distractions around me. I fully utilized the leftover time in each module to review every single question, sometimes even solving the same question twice. I also made full use of the desmos calculator provided with the test.\n\nI sat down for the complete test time, closing my eyes and mentally preparing for the math section during the 10 minute break between R&W and math sections.  \n\n\nI had a school holiday so I wasn't exhausted after coming home too.  \n\n\nAll these factors put together helped me score so much better than my previous, non-serious attempts.", "score": 22, "author": "Cautious-Ad-600"}, {"id": "jh4p2wk", "body": "In 2 days?

I gave paper SAT in december and got a 720. Took March DSAT and got a 800. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Practice. Practice. Practice... I can't stress this enough but the key to achieving a perfect score in Maths is just getting to know the questions. This would help you alot on the test as you wouldn't have to think too much about how to approach a question.\n2. While the paper based SAT math has some differences, It is a great resource to practice as it tackles almost all the questions that appear on the DSAT. Look through the past papers available in the megathread. Try to learn the concepts and then attempt complete math sections. Check your answers and mark those which you usually get wrong.\n3. There are alot of great books available for preparation. I personally like PWN SAT Math, College Panda SAT MATH. They go through the concepts thoroughly and also give you tricks and tips to save time.\n4. Try to save time for the hard questions. Hard questions usually are the last ones. Sometimes you would waste so much time going through the easy ones that there isn't much time for the hard ones. Some hard questions can require additional time compared to other questions. Try to save time for such questions.\n5. From what i've heard, The first module of the Math Section mostly determines your end score. Try to maximize your score on this section. The second module can be lenient even if you get a few wrong questions.\n\nI hope these tips would be useful for you! One last thing: The first DSAT focused alot on Parabola and Circle Formulas.

Either do Khan Academy or go onto college boards' websites and do every single one of the practice tests - and before you ask, it's perfectly doable in 2 weeks. In fact we may finish before the 2 weeks. \n\nDo one or 2 \"parts\" of the sat practice tests. A part means reading or math, for reading I mean the readings and grammar and for math I mean both sections. Grade yourself and see what you did wrong. Then review it. Say, for example, you mess up on a circle equation problem in math. In the next 15-30 minutes, you'll have memorized the circle equation and done at least one full worksheet on circle equations. Circle equations should become one of your favorite new topics. Rinse and repeat. I highly recommend you do both parts (meaning whole test) in a day, but you can start off easy for a day or 2. No matter what you choose to do, always time yourself. When you finish with a test, grade it, and like I said, \"patch up\" any issues. The idea is that you get to know the format really well and get a good idea of what the sat questions look like.\n\nGoing from 1000 to a 1400 or even 1500 won't be easy. Expect to study at least 2-3 hours per day. If you  stick to this plan and are dedicated, you'll succeed. If you don't stick to this plan, you won't achieve a high score.

For the record, I've been teaching ACT/SAT classes for 30 years, so what I think is funny is how this new, new, new, new SAT is mostly made up of stuff from old SATs, as well as old GRE and GMAT tests.\n\nHere's what you can do NOW using current and old official College Board SAT tests:\n\n1. The English grammar tested is nearly the same, so doing old Writing tests will absolutely help, especially focus on punctuation and transition questions. Those damn colons are still really popular.\n2. The math is also practically the same. Doing current SAT math tests will also help a great deal. Skip the questions that have two questions based on a thing, and skip the really long story problems - yeah!\n3. Vocabulary is going to be a thing again, I suspect. I saw \"buttress\" used on a fill-in question, and I doubt too many high school juniors know that word. If your school has an English class with vocabulary, take it!\n4. ACT Science tests have a passage with conflicting views. They might be good practice for a very popular type of new SAT reading question: \"What would support (or weaken) the claim made by the author in the text?\" These are asked in the ACT Science test in the conflicting views passage - not exactly the same, but in the ball park anyway.\n5. Data interpretation questions are still part of the new SAT Reading test, so old SAT reading tests with passages with graphs would be good to use for the 1 or 2 graph reading questions.\n6. Here's a secret tip that I really shouldn't be passing on to civilians: SAT tests from the 2000's had \"mini\" reading passages, even mini double passages. They would be very good to use for practice for many of the \"new\" reading questions. In fact, I wonder if some of the \"new\" questions will be dug up from SATs from 20 years ago. I think that one website \"crackSAT\" had SAT tests from that era.\n\nTake AP English if at all possible!

For starters, I was informed they would provide a calculator for the math portion, they ended up not having one yesterday (sections 1-3, didn't need it anyways) but got one today. So she hands me this rinky dink 2 by 3 inch four function calculator, can't even square things, doesn't have pi. I know usually you bring your own, and even though they were the ones who told me i dont need to bring one, I still understood i wouldn't be getting the best tools to work with. But i mentioned how it had so few functions and the proctor told me that this is what the coordinator provided and that scientific! and graphing! calculators! weren't ALLOWED??!! I asked if she was sure because a lot of the math requires scientific functions, my math teacher offered to loan me a scientific calculator and everyone talks about using one in the SATs. She just said only four function calculators are allowed. It's her first time as a proctor and i didnt want any issues so i just used it. Looked it up afterwards, not only do they reccomend scientific and graphing calcs, they specifically state on the website they do not recommend a four function calc. Luckily didn't need it much anyways, would have been nice for a lot of geometry though. \n\n(context: I was allowed accommodations to take the test privately) Then after I had completed the math calc section and she had started to read the manual for the essay portion she said i had 55 minutes for the essay. I knew that was wrong because thats the standard time and i have time and a half. She kept saying thats what it says on her book but i finally got her to check and not only was she going to give me standard time for the essay, she had already given me standard time for the math section. I was really worried they were going to make me retake it again, or my answers would be messed up because i had to erase all the ones i was forced to guess last minute. After about 15 minutes of trying to get a hold of the coordinator she finally got the okay to give me my remaining time (most of which was spent erasing).

    {"subreddit": "Sat", "body": "I spent countless hours studying and I came up with a process to consistently max out my SAT math score.  That way I spent most of my mental energy on the reading and writing.  I'm excited to share my process that helped me achieve 1560 with a 800 on math. One thing to note is I\u2019m not some genius who was scoring 700+ from the womb my first practice test I got a 550 on math.\n\n\u2014How long did this improvement take?\u2014\n\nI took the PSAT sophomore year did alright but didn\u2019t study and just neglected the SAT as a whole until September of junior year. I would advise to start studying the summer before junior year.\n\nMy first practice test on khan academy, I got a 550 on math. I realized I had forgotten a lot of the concepts tested. I made a plan at this point to really begin preparing for the November SAT. I needed it to be structured and later I called this the process.\n\n\u2014One piece of advise is to make a reasonable study plan and set small goals\u2014\n\nMy study plan:\n\n\u201445 minutes to an hour a day with extensive review on questions I got wrong\u2014\n\n\u20141 practice test every week\u2014\n\nThis may seem like a lot but try to stay consistent with your practice. \nConsistency > length of practice. \n\n\u2014Practice Tests\u2014\n\nWhen I began to take practice tests seriously, I came up with a process with the math section,  I saw my score skyrocket. I took every test at 8am on a Saturday morning. I would simulate a test like environment. I\u2019d put my phone in another room and pull up a SAT test timer on my Chromebook. I would bring snacks and take breaks just like the real test. \n\nWhen I finished, I would take a break.  Then I spent considerable time ***reviewing** my mistakes. This was crucial for improving my math score especially. Really working through the problems and solving them in the best way possible was key. That approach to solving them, using the key formulas, made math easier and easier.\n\n\u2014Khan Academy\u2014\n\nI found khan academy useful for reading and writing especially the practice passages they have. However the math was definitely lacking I had maxed out all the skills and still had trouble cracking 700. \n\n\u2014Other advice\u2014\n\nI would recommend taking the real SAT test multiple times.  I took it 3 times and am glad I did. The first test should be viewed as a trial run. The second and third should be where you start performing at your peak.\n\nPersonally my second test went horribly, I omitted a couple questions accidentally so don\u2019t put too much pressure on a single test. \n\nWhen in doubt, plug in answers! This is useful for all the sections, but especially helpful in math when you find yourself stuck on a problem or confused between two options.\n\nIn the math section **Underline** what the question is asking to avoid silly mistakes. For example solving for x instead of x-y. \n\n\u2014Stay relaxed\u2014\n\nDon\u2019t spend too long on a question if you don\u2019t see the answer mark it and come back to it. Try not to place too much stress on yourself and get a good night\u2019s sleep the week leading up to the test. \n\nPersonally I cut my studying down the week before which helped me I believe as it prevented testing fatigue and burnout. \n\n**Feel free to ask me any questions below or PM me as well!**\n\nThis is my thank you to this sub because it has helped me so much along my journey!

For any question where you don\u2019t know the exact method you would take, go only onto YouTube or whatever and learn how to do those kinds of problems. After that u can actually properly take the maths questions and see how you do. In fairness I\u2019ve only done 1 pass paper before so I can\u2019t say this with certainty, but I would assume the questions on the sat are all quite similar in the areas that the test on, so if u understand how to do the questions in general then it just becomes a game of getting ur speed up without sacrificing accuracy", "score": 1, "author": "Weebaku"}]},
