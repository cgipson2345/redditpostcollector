I'll share the response I got but I can't endorse it because I don't know any more than you.\n\n\n\nTo dry and preserve cedar limbs for walking sticks, it's best to follow these steps:\n\n1.\tStrip off the bark: This is an optional step, but it can help prevent any insects from burrowing into the bark and damaging the wood. Use a sharp knife or a scraper to remove the bark carefully.\n2.\tAllow the wood to dry: Place the cedar limbs in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight. You want to avoid exposing the wood to heat, as it can cause the wood to crack and warp. Depending on the size of the limbs, it may take several weeks or even a few months for them to dry completely.\n3.\tSand and shape the walking sticks: Once the cedar limbs are dry, use sandpaper to smooth out any rough spots and shape the sticks to your liking. You can use a saw or a knife to cut the sticks to the desired length.\n4.\tApply a finish: To protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty, you can apply a finish to the walking sticks. There are many different types of finishes available, such as linseed oil, varnish, or wax. Apply the finish according to the manufacturer's instructions and allow it to dry completely before handling the sticks.\n\nAs for the oak tree, the process will be similar. Strip off the bark, allow the wood to dry, sand and shape the sticks, and apply a finish. However, oak is a hardwood and will take longer to dry than cedar. It's important to be patient and allow the wood to dry completely before using it for walking sticks.", "score": 4, "author": "ItsAllegorical"}, {"id": "jh7yqmp", "body": "I travelled for many years and cut many sticks. First, determine whether to bark strip or not, for some sticks its beneficial to remove rot or weak points, for some it better to leave it on.\n\n Next steps deal with the leftover water inside the stick, how you want the stick to balance after drying, and how you want to seal the wood. \n\nNow, cheap & easy, pick up some lacquer and coat it.  But for quality, follow below.\n\nA green cut stick can take from 3-8 weeks to dry out properly, as it dries it can cure to harden in specific ways. The decision to make is where you want the weight of the stick. If you want a specific side of the stick to remain heavier, then hold the stick by the opposite end and spin it for 30-ish minutes 3-4 times a day, 15-30 minutes at a time. This will shift the cell walls of the wood internally to move the water, and debris the water carries, to the end of the stick. To have a balanced stick, spin from the center, or focus on holding the heavier side more often while spinning. \n\n\nNext is to decide how to seal, many wood finishes and sealants can work very well, but the best finished staves ive ever made were done with linseed oil and sunlight baking. \n\nGood luck with your project!", "score": 3, "author": "disorderly_ants"}, {"id": "jh7vity", "body": "bark must be removed or it will decompose", "score": 1, "author": "eriffodrol"}]},

But once the holes for the door hinges are drilled and the hinge screws are put in, it\u2019s a real pain to remove the hinges, epoxy in toothpicks in the old screw holes, then drill new screw holes for the hinges. \n\nThe trim on the door frame is stained wood, the door is painted white. You need to pull the door off the hinges ( just remove the hinge pins) and then decide which one is easier for you to cut down and either re-stain or re-paint. Personally, I\u2019d cut about an 1/8\u201d of the front edge of the door and repaint it. It\u2019ll be much easier just to lay the door flat on a set of saw horses, set your skill saw blade at a 45 degree angle, clamp a fence (just use a long 2x4 to the door and rip off about 1/8\u201d of that edge of the door and ten repaint. You could also do this with a plane or a sanding block with a really rough grit sandpaper if you don\u2019t have a skill saw.  To repaint the door, the new paint will always be a different (brighter or more glossy than the original paint) so just use a really fine trim paint brush or you could even just use a q-tip and ONLY re-paint where you removed the base material. Being in the corner of the door, it won\u2019t be noticeable. The door is a laminated hollow core door but (with you only needing to remove about 1/8\u201d) will have about a 2\u201d solid wood piece on the outside edges so you shouldn\u2019t need worry about taking too much material off and exposing the different layers of the door. \n\nYou could try to cut the door frame trip piece down but you\u2019ll have difficulty getting it cut at the top where it meets the upper door header and the bottom where it meets the floor. That would mean you have to remove those areas with a really sharp chisel and run the risk of the chisel digging into the grain of the wood and splintering the wood taking off way more than you really want. \n\nThus, way easier to remove material from the door and repaint versus the door jam.", "score": 1, "author": "Dirk1935"}]},

Particleboard is a very weak material consisting of sawdust held together with a glue.  Literally.  That is why the drawer failed with the normal stresses of opening and closing the drawer: when closing it, the momentum of the drawer being suddenly stopped by the drawer front as it contacts the cabinet face places sharp stresses on the drawer components. Also, the simple 45 degree miter joint of the drawer corner is a very poor design for that area. \n\nThe fix isn\u2019t that hard: \n\nYou will need:\n- good wood glue (ex: Titebond I, II, or III formulations are available in small bottles, Elmer\u2019s Carpenter\u2019s glue is good for this too). All these glues are water soluable - that is important for cleanup later on.  I would not advise Gorilla Glue or any other polyurethane glue if you are not a woodworker. \n- some way to hold the drawer together while the wood dries.  Large rubber bands, painter\u2019s tape, Saran Wrap, etc are all good options. You want something that is kind of elastic. You should not have to buy any (expensive) clamps. \n\nHow to do it: \n- first, remove that screw and any other foreign material (nails, etc) from the joint\n- then push everything together to see how well it fits.  Remove any wooden shards that interfere with the joint fitting together closely. You want no gaps, or as small a gap as you can get.\n- some of the drawer side is missing, ignore that for now.\n- once you are satisfied with the fitup, apply the glue and wrap the drawer with the material (rubber band, painters tape, Saran Wrap, etc) in such a way as to hold the joint closely together. \n- clean up any glue squeeze-out with damp paper towels.\n- let it dry for 24 hours\n\nThe wood glue in a tight joint (little gaps) will be stronger than the wood it is holding together. \n\nAssess:\n- another commenter recommended screwing on an \u201cL\u201d bracket inside the drawer. If the drawer integrity is questionable at this point, you should look at doing that. \n\nHope this helps.

My guess is your door is sagging a little and that you will find that the latch is hitting a little to low against the plate to go in. If that's the case, then the easiest fix might be to get some longer screws and replace the screws in the top door hinges to square everything up.", "score": 2, "author": "Advisor_Grouchy"}, {"id": "jgtu9n4", "body": "So your door is really chewed up. Lots of issues here.\nFirst the door jam, the wood around the door is about 5/8\" think, that's great for the plate when in good condition. But I can see the holes look like they are in bad condition. So trying to set the plate will be tricky.\nTypically your jam is about 1/8\" from the framing 2x4. That's much better wood and will take a screw and hold it there, but there still an issue with the screw holes in the jam so you'll need to correct that or the plate won't be secure.\nCouple things you can do: you can use long slivers of wood, I use a sharp knife or chisel to shave scraps of 2x4, or a couple tooth picks or a wooden match sick, use lots of white or wood glue, and tap the wood into the screw holes. Let the wood dry for a couple days, then cleanup anything that sticks out and smooth with a medium sandpaper. Then you can drill new holes for the screws and they will be tight.\nNext, placing the strike plate, if your not sure, here's some tips, you need to know where the latch wants to rest. Door hardware usually comes with a template that shows you where to drill holes and route your strike plate. If you don't have that, if you feel confident you can eyeball where the latch passes over the jam and pencil mark the top and bottom, otherwise you can use crayon, pencil or chalk to mark where you latch goes. Scrape off the creation onto the latch the open and close the door and hope it leaves a mark you can see. I've used carbon paper for this as well.\nMake sure the latch itself freely moves in and out the door, sometimes that can be the problem, if the latch sticks, it won't work.\nAlso check the distance between the door and the jam, it should be only about 1/8\". If that's good and you know where to place the latch, you can do a dry test by tapeing the latch with painters tape, poke or cut out latch hole in the tape,  then check your placement, you want the door to be snug with the jam stop, or the door will make noise. The tape doesn't work great but you can here the latch click as it passes the plate, just as it feels closed. If the latch is to far back, the door will hit the jam stop before it latches. If you live in a country where you get both humid and dry periods, you may need to compensate a bit or the door won't close in humid weather or will rattle and feel loose in the dry weather.\nOnce you've confirmed the plate location, mark the screw holes and drill new holes, if your filing and re-drilling the holes get longer screws, 1\u00bd\" will secure the plate through the jam into the 2x4 behind it. Be careful not to over tighten or you can actually pull the jam into the wood, making the problem worse.\nLooking at that jam you need more that a coat of paint, if your trying to clean up the whole thing, use a good fibre based filler.\nIf this side of the jam looks this bad, the hinge side might also be at fault. If the hinges are binding or your torquing on the jam that might be messing with the doors alignment. If you can jiggle the door, you've found the real problem, the door is pulling out of its hinges and probably hanging a bit low, this will cause the latch to miss the hole in the strike plate and possibly even the drilled hole.\nYou can try the fill and drill trick with the hinge screws, but there comes a point where replacing the jam and door is the better option.\nGood luck!", "score": 2, "author": "RepresentativeMove79"}, {"id": "jgrpfpi", "body": "Put a piece of double sided tape behind the catch plate to gap it out a little further.

It can indeed be unpleasant and potentially harmful to inhale secondhand smoke for extended periods of time. Here are some steps you can take to try to eliminate or reduce the smoke smell:\n\nVentilate the apartment: Open windows and use fans to increase airflow in the apartment. This can help to reduce the concentration of smoke particles in the air.\n\nDeep clean: Thoroughly clean all surfaces in the apartment, including walls, ceilings, floors, and furniture. Use a mixture of warm water and mild detergent to clean surfaces, and consider using an odor-neutralizing cleaner specifically designed for smoke odors. Don't forget to clean curtains, blinds, and any other soft furnishings that may have absorbed the smell.\n\nWash clothing and other fabric items: Launder all clothing, bedding, and other fabric items in the apartment, including curtains, rugs, and upholstery. Use a strong detergent and consider adding baking soda or vinegar to the wash to help neutralize odors.\n\nAir purifiers: Consider using air purifiers with HEPA filters to help capture smoke particles from the air. Place them strategically in different rooms to cover the entire apartment.\n\nRemove carpets and repaint walls: If possible, remove any carpets or rugs in the apartment, as they can absorb smoke odors. Repaint walls with a fresh coat of paint to help seal in the smell.\n\nContact the landlord: If you're renting the apartment, it's important to notify your landlord about the smoke smell and request their assistance in resolving the issue. They may be able to take additional measures, such as professionally cleaning the ventilation system or treating the walls with a sealant.\n\nSeek legal advice: If you believe your apartment is not up to code or that your health is being affected by the smoke smell, you may want to seek legal advice from a tenant advocacy organization or a lawyer specializing in tenant rights. They may be able to provide guidance on your rights and options for addressing the issue with your landlord.\n\nRemember to prioritize your and your daughter's health and safety.

And that requires access to the isometric parts catalogue and service manual for that particular Electrolux model. Which you can usually find online through various parts suppliers for washers.\n\nThat being said, I'm currently sitting waiting on a fix for my own frontload washer because the hinge on the door assembly is cracked and crumbling, and the door surround is sagging. The assembly I have to replace? $400. Not including the labor required to install it properly, which is going to be the appliance repair guy's job, bringing it up to around $550.\n\nThe price for a brand-new frontload washer of the same brand, on sale right now at Costco? $750.\n\nIt's really, REALLY tempting. \n\nBut I have to say I really, REALLY hate the idea of trashing an eight year old washer because of a stupid plastic door.\n\nIt breaks again in the next two years, yeah, I'm getting a new one. But damn.\n\nSo TLDR: you'll have to disassemble the locking mechanism and disengage the solenoid, then remove the piece. You will have to purchase or find someone with an identical part for the locking mechanism because it won't be a glue-back-on situation. But chances are, you'll wind up needing to spend around $150 for a single part online and then having to either disassemble the front of the washer to install it, or, if you're very, very lucky, just swap and replace the old pieces with the new ones.", "score": 2, "author": "MaleficentPi"}]},
