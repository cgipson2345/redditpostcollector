Animals don\u2019t get ulcers, because they respond to physical stresses, and the effects of stress (increased heart rate, blood flow, heightened awareness, adrenaline) are good for animals because it keeps them alive.\n\nHumans living in society react to psychological stress, like the news, taxes, upcoming exams. But stress still affects you physically. Constant increased heart rate is not good for the body. And your body isn\u2019t releasing that through a physical fight/ flight, so you never get the release. \n\nStress increases cortisol, which is good if you are physically fighting / surviving. Not good when constants because it shuts down long term function. That\u2019s why we get depressed under stress, because our minds and body have deprioritized long term concerns. \n\nThis includes sex drive. Our bodies have a hard time thinking of reproduction, when it\u2019s trying to optimize for immediate survival. \n\nThe good thing is, stress has physical reactions, but it can also be mitigated by physical factors. This is why breathing is effective. It tricks our brain into thinking we are no longer in fight / flight. \n\nOr exercise. It gets our mind to focus on the immediate physical task before it, and deprioritizes  other concerns. It also gets your body to pump out endorphins like dopamine.  \n\nEven if none of the above works, it is still better to have a no worries mentality because you will live longer w/ less stress.", "score": 5, "author": "blk_arrow"}]}

They wanted an increase of $1,412 monthly. That is a 58% increase, pretty pie in the sky for any job.\n\nThird, they were getting their tuition and healthcare paid for, also a signing bonus, and UCSC offered an additional $2,500 during the strike. Taken together, this is about 30-40k of additional compensation they were receiving. They also, of course, would get a degree out of it. So conservatively, they were earning about $50,000 per year for their 20 hour a week teaching jobs while getting a degree. Keep in mind that their jobs and classes were only 9 month out the year as well, so they had an additional 3 months to earn other income from other jobs.\n\nFourth, many graduate programs in other professions require you to pay for your tuition and health insurance. Ask any lawyer, physician, RN, pharmacist, social worker, MBA, physical therapist, CPA, architect to name a few. Many graduate studies require people to work part time or full time jobs and in most of these programs students generally go into debt.\n\nFifth, the undergraduate students who paid to be at UCSC were unable to get their grades for months. To make it even worse, strikes included actually disturbing students while taking midterms.\n\nI cannot comprehend how anyone could think it was worth it to loose all of their compensation and their graduate degree over roughly $12,000 per year (their requested increase). My bet is most will regret their decision to loose their degree over a relatively small amount. Keep in mind, I am not saying they don't have the right to strike. They can strike, fight for whatever they want, no matter how unreasonable. I am just saying this seems like poor decision making, and now that they are out of their jobs, they are going to have a hard time finding anything even remotely as well paying, not to mention the lost future earnings of not earning their degree.\n\nPlease let me know if I have made any factual mistakes or if you actually have responses to these arguments, when I have tried to present this info. in the past I was downvoted, but no one ever bothered to even try to argue a different position and/or their arguments were made in bad faith.

Revenue and expenditures have likely increased 4 years later, but the $13 mil represents a 1.8% increase in operational cost. The UCSC administration would have to cut other programs' budgets in order to make the difference.\n\nI'm an UCSC alumnus, and I served as a student rep on UCSC's Academic Senate's Committee on Planning and Budget (CPB). I've sided with the graduate students in this case. If you follow this subreddit, you will see the student body is largely divided on the issue. Now, subreddit posts are a small sample of the student body.But, it does affect the perception as well as the notoriety of UCSC being a liberal school full of hippies that always fight for worker's rights. It is harder to rebuild that kind of reputation in the school's brand. And it also negatively affects alumni fundraising.\n\nIt puts the UCSC administration between a rock and a hard place. I've worked with the administration in the past. They are intelligent and caring faculty members trying to walk a tight rope every year with UCOP/Regents increasingly demanding in delivering in business objectives (increase enrollment/revenue) on one side and their academic mission on the other. I do not envy them.\n\nUCOP miscalculated this entire affair. UCSC grads going on strike has also encouraged UC Berkeley's and Davis's grads to strike in solidarity.

This is patently false, it is a norm to receive financial support for a PhD program. It is also ridiculous to charge tuition to fourth and fifth year students who don't take any classes.\n\n2. So what if it is voluntary? Why should that mean that people that choose grad school have to live in a financially precarious position? \n\n3. I agree, so maybe the university should grant a COLA so grads go back to the classroom.\n\n4. Unfortunately I can't explain empathy to you. I understand that this is a survivable situation for single grad students, but alot of other people are in positions of precarity. Your argument would make grad school a less accessible and more exclusive program (to low income folk, to people with children, to people that have family commitments, etc). Maybe you are okay with that, but many people aren't.\n\nMoreover, I'm gonna press you on this claim that we are paid a livable wage. Do you have the money to afford a surprise $2000 emergency (medical bills, you get unjustly evicted, car repair, etc)? My guess is the answer is no (and if you do, you are better off than most grad students here). That is not a livable wage then, you exist, day to day, on the brink of financial ruin if something goes wrong. That's not okay.\n\n5. $2500 is a good starting point, I think honestly $5000-$7000 would be enough to break the strike. Unfortunately $2500 only amounts to a couple hundred a month. This is woefully insufficient for most grad students, and will be outpaced by housing costs in about 2-3 years. I'm glad you are financially stable enough to put this money into stocks though.\n\n6. The UAW has been a huge source of frustration for strikers. You could argue, by breaking engaging in a wildcat strike and opening the UAW up to ULP charges, the strike is a refutation of the UAW. Unfortunately, the process of breaking away from the UAW is not really clear (might actually be impossible based off a few California Supreme Court decisions), although the idea has come up.\n\nHowever, the idea that the UAW doesn't want grads to have a COLA is simply not true. The ULP charges they filed were because UCSC negotiated outside of the contract. Their position is that a cost of living adjustment needs to be negotiated as a side letter or through a reopening of the contract. This is partly to preserve their own power and authority, but also to protect students. No one has really mentioned this, but the university is currently under no obligation to continue offering the programs they promised. Since it isn't part of a contract, they could renege at any time and we wouldn't be able to do anything about it.\n\nIt's also a little strange you focus on this one ULP charge when the UAW has filed dozens, several of which relate to the termination of grad students. The school does appear to have also broken the contract in the firing process and unfairly targeted union members (for example, they only rescinded spring TAships, not GSR positions for ppl witholding grades). The UAW is potentially authorizing a full strike in early April over these ULPs.\n\nSo yeah, the union isn't great and their shitty bargaining and apathy got us into this mess. But to depict them as totally against the interests of the COLA movement is dishonest.\n\n7. Yes, the housing crises is partially a result of homeowner interests in Santa Cruz. It is also the result of the university pushing an unsustainable development policy. They have aggressively admitted more undergrads each year without building new housing or ensuring that new housing would be built in the city. So they are far from blameless in this mess.\n\nUnfortunately, systemic changes take time, and the needs of grad students are pressing, not something that can wait 5 years to be fixed. However, policy changes on the local and state level are not mutually exclusive with the university granting a COLA. To that end, the COLA movement has been engaged in local and state policies. They have been raising awareness and phone banking for progressive candidates from the city council through the state senate. \n\n8. Let's not die on the hill of ideological purity. It sucks that slum lord's aren't being punished, but grad students being able to survive is more important. This is also a strange argument to make, because landlords don't really reap any benefit from COLA (1000 people having more money to spend won't cause any significant change in the Santa Cruz housing market), and won't be harmed in any way if grad students don't get a COLA.\n\n9. That's not the goal of the COLA movement, the goal of the COLA movement is a COLA. Again, you keep asserting being given a stipend in a PhD program isn't a norm, but it is. Sure, PhD students aren't the most vulnerable members of society and might not garner the most sympathy, but so far we've been doing a decent job (alumni association witholding donations, 3000 academics cutting ties with the UC, state assembly members telling Janet to reopen the contract, Bernie supporting us). It's also worth noting that public appeal is only one part of the COLA campaign. There are plenty of other ways strikers can force the university's hand without having widespread popular support (shutting down campus, witholding grades, etc.)\n\nYou also make this claim that strikers are asking for too much. That might be somewhat fair, but the public position has always been that that is a starting point and they are open to negotiating with the admin. I'm guessing people would probably settle for half of that, but again, it's hard to know when the admin hasn't even tried to negotiate.\n\n10. Then the school can try and withold pay.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you've experienced hardships here (as have many grads) and I understand why you don't blame the university for those hardships. At the same time, alot of your take seems to rest on this idea that you don't expect to be compensated during a PhD program. But you are working for the university, in fact, you are bringing a valuable and skilled piece of labor to the table for far below market price (think of what they would have to pay to replace TAs with adjuncts and lecturers).

That's a lose-lose scenario for grad students; admin has them in checkmate.\n\nI hope the sit-ins this week change all that though.

I think it's pretty clear why the administration won't talk to strikers: the Union won't let them.\n\nI can tell you quite soundly that PhD funding depends on the institution you're attending.  Other institutions like private colleges pay adjunct faculty a few thousand dollars to teach a 16-week course.  I remember one adjunct faculty member telling me go got paid about $3000 to teach an entire semester....That's less than $1000 per month with no benefits.  That same college was changing each student over $7000 to take the course.  Full-time professors at many other universities teach three classes each instead of the one that UC faculty teach.  PhD students only get paid for being TAs when the University in question has TA positions that need to be filled.  I went to four colleges and universities before UCSC that had no TAs, and consequently PhD students had to PAY for their entire degree (with the exception of a couple PhD students each year who received full-ride fellowships).\n\nAlso, it strikes me that the argument in favor of COLA is analogous to a minimum wage law applied without regard to the underlying reasons why the cost of living has increased faster than incomes.  The argument against the University admitting and enrolling more and more students each year is analogous to arguments made against immigration to the United States.  Immigration increases the demand for housing and increases the supply of workers relative to the job market, and these it turn increase the cost of living while suppressing the wages of many workers.  I'm not saying that strikers are anti-immigration by any means, but I want to point out that you have more in common with people that you see as your political \"adversaries\" than perhaps you realize.\n\nWe need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life.", "score": 0, "author": "LiveYourBestLife2"}, {"id": "fk6wzb7", "body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "author": "None"}, {"id": "fj2x9yr", "body": "How will this make anything friendlier?", "score": 11, "author": "None"}, {"id": "fj4n4z6", "body": "Even a simple honor system with a check once in awhile on their free time or more appointed mods would be nice.

The union filed ULP charges because the UCSC admin tried to circumvent the union in negotiations (among several other charges related to violating due process rights of TAs). To protray the intransigence of the adminstration as a problem with  the union, when the union has been willing to negotiate early in this process, is pretty dishonest. \n\nI agree PhD funding depends on the institution, and there are certainly institutions that don't fund their students. That doesn't change the fact that is the norm among major universities and colleges to fund their students. I'm honestly curious what schools you are referencing that didn't fund their PhD students, because my guess is they probably don't have that many PhD students and certainly not high caliber ones. When I was going through the application process, my advisor's told me that a lack of funding for PhD students is a huge red flag for that program. I don't want to leave you with only some random anecdotes and conjecture, so here's some stats: https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/phd-student-salary-SRCH_KO0,11.htm. UCSC is about 3000 below the average, and it appears the median salary is even higher.\n\nI don't think COLA is mutually exclusive with understanding the underlying issues that cause cost of living to increase, but it is important nonetheless. Yes, fixing the systemic causes of the cost of living increase is important, but that doesn't mean that you ignore the conditions people face right now. Your minimum wage argument is a bad one because yes, people should be paid enough to live, regardless of the underlying reason for why the cost of living is high. \n\nArguing against unsustainable expansion is not the same as opposing immigration in the US (lol). Yes immigration increases housing demand, but that's defuse over large regions of the country. Also new houses are constantly being built and there are currently more houses than people in the US. The arguments about how it affects labor market supply have empirically been demonstrated false. The piece of analysis that you are missing is that while it increases the supply of labor in the market, it also increases the demand of labor (due to more consumption). \n\nThis is obviously not the same as university expansion. Santa Cruz is a closed housing market. No new developments have been built for several years and it's not easy to commute from nearby regions. We also currently have more students than there are rooms in the city (and university). \n\nIgnoring those key differences in housing markets to somehow equate the ideology of strikers with those of the political right is intellectually lazy. I'd also add that strikers aren't against university expansion in general, but rather unsustainable expansion. At the point where we don't have rooms for any new students, maybe we should stop letting in students until we build new rooms. If the university increased the housing supply while simultaneously growing it's student base, no one would be complaining, but that's not what they did. \n\n\nWhile I agree with the sentiment that \"We need policies that make it easier for every member of our society to live a decent life\", I'm still left wondering how you plan to do that. It's easy to talk about systemic causes, but harder to come to the table with concrete policy proposals to fix the problem.

To pretend as if those events did not happen and that the UAW is actively intimidating an otherwise cooperative university away from the bargaining table is as dishonest as it is silly.\n\nYou say \"it is not intellectually lazy to observe similarities between the reasoning of anti-immigration and anti-growth advocates.\" I'm not sure you've actually made an argument about the \"reasoning\" of these groups, I think you've just pointed out that the thesis claims that they are making bear some passing resemblances to each other. Regardless, it is fascinating to me that instead of engaging with the substance of my previous reply, which delved into the reasons why these contrived surface level similarities do not reflect an underlying sameness in reasoning or ideology, you continue to distract with outrage over my word choice. Ironically, engaging with the substance of my argument to demonstrate deeper connections in the underlying philosophy of these groups would probably be the best defense against a claim of intellectual laziness. Your unwillingness to do so demonstrates to me that  there is likely not enough of an argument there to seriously make that case. \n\nI do not believe that in general appropriating or repurposing ideas is bad. I just find it hyperbolic (to say the least) that you would use a quote condemning the Holocaust in the context of having your argument called dishonest. I also find the claim that \"you show only that you are unwilling or unable to reason with me calmly and convincingly\" ironic in the context of this discussion. Instead of replying to the substance of my previous reply, you chose to wax poetic about my choice of words. That's fine, but it's rich for you to call me out for being unwilling to reason with you, when in fact it is you who is no longer willing to engage.\n\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that you describe yourself as someone who \"disagrees with you due to the approach that the COLA movement has taken\", many of your original reasons to oppose the movement were not questions of execution. By that I mean that they were not arguments that condemned only the method of the movement. Instead, several of the arguments in your original comment seem to imply that you think that the very goal of this movement is unreasonable, that the university bears little to no responsibility to its grad students and that grad students are already fairly compensated. That is not disagreeing over the approach the movement has taken, that is disagreeing over the very question of the movement itself. \n\nYour unwillingness to seriously engage in the arguments I've presented indicates to me that your mind on this topic is already made up. There is nothing I could say that would persuade you to even have a modicum of support for the movement. Am I wrong? You listed 10 arguments at the beginning of this thread and only continued to argue over a couple. Did I persuade you on those other fronts? Or do you still stand by your original argument?

{"subreddit": "UCI", "body": "# Welcome, current and incoming Anteaters!\n\n[*Zot zot zot!*](https://bpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/sites.uci.edu/dist/a/2791/files/2015/09/anteater.png) As you may have long noticed (at the time of this writing), the season is ripe for admission decisions! The community has been welcoming new Anteaters most eager to embark on an exciting journey to *consume every last ant in SoCal!* *^(Just kidding... or am I?)*\n\nThis megathread aims to (hopefully) provide succinct explanations and/or answers for the most commonly asked questions. Much like the previous megathread, this is also the place to discuss acceptances, ask questions, or answer questions about anything and everything about UCI! Lastly, if there is anything that you feel would be helpful in addition to the topics already addressed (or if something is erroneous), please don't be shy about leaving any comments, feedback, or suggestions!\n\n# I got into UCI as [major/undeclared]. Can I change my major?\n\n*Yes, you absolutely can!*\n\nFirst, you'd want to have the [UCI General Catalogue](https://catalogue.uci.edu/) handy *^(Pssst! Bookmark it now!)*. The General Catalogue is updated every year and contains every single minor/major that UCI has to offer as well as the requirements needed to complete a degree/meet graduation. Some even provide sample study plans! This is where you'll also find the complete list of courses for the current year. If you are ever confused about the name or content of a class, you'll likely find your answer here.\n\nSearch for the major you are interested in to be sure that the courses, descriptions, and general path are something you really want. Next, check this [link](https://changeofmajor.uci.edu/) to see the Change of Major criteria for the major you want to switch into (categorised by school). If you wish to add a second or third major, it follows the same requirements as listed in the website above.\n\n1. Consult with an academic counselor in your School first. They have access to your student profile and can help you determine whether a switch is possible as well as guide you in the process. I would also recommend visiting an academic counselor in the School of your prospective major.\n2. Follow the requirements as listed in the Change of Major website.\n3. After completing the necessary requirements, apply for a change of major under the \"Applications\" section of your StudentAccess account. This will be a place you'll visit often as your StudentAccess account has other information such as your unofficial transcript, a GPA calculator, and so on. Here is a [link](https://reg.uci.edu/) to where you'd find this. You'll be visiting the linked site often when you're a student as it is the portal to registering for classes and has other helpful information such as the current Schedule of Classes.\n4. If approved, you'll see it reflected under the Applications tab and in your DegreeWorks. Here is an [example](https://i.imgur.com/pMcvBS5.png) for a double major. *(Note that both majors were kept in this instance\u2014otherwise, one major would have a red minus sign to the right of \"Approved\" indicating a drop.)*\n\n**Note:** If you are an incoming freshman, I would *not* stress over needing to change your major immediately. You will be spending a large duration of your time during the first two years at UCI completing your General Education requirements rather than taking courses specific to a major. That's not to say you can't work towards completing the criteria you need to change your major (and many GE classes do count towards lower-division major requirements as well). However, it does not need to be an immediate thing\u2014and in most cases, cannot be an immediate thing as it may take a few quarters of taking classes in order to meet a Change of Major criteria.\n\n# Can I change my major to Computer Science?\n\n*Yes, you can!*\n\nHowever, note that it'll be something that many others will be looking to do as well. **If you are a transfer outside of the School of ICS, this may not be possible.** I would speak with an academic counselor first. Changing your major to Computer Science follows much of the same process for any other major, with a few caveats.\n\nThe School of ICS, which hosts majors such as Computer Science, Data Science, and Informatics, is *extremely impacted!* This means that if you were not accepted as an ICS student, you may have a difficult time swapping in because everyone will be trying to get into ICS 31 and students already under the School will have priority registration. ICS 31 to ICS 33 is a one-year track of Python programming that almost every major under the School of ICS needs to graduate. So you'd essentially be competing with students who need the course for their degree as well as prospective students looking to swap in (you'll need to complete the entire series to switch). That's not saying it's entirely impossible to get in, but you'd have to keep a close eye on the class as there is no waitlist as well. And if you find yourself really struggling to get in, there are other options to consider:\n\n1. Take the course during the summer ten-week session. Note that if you receive financial aid during the standard school year, it does not apply towards summer sessions. You will have to look into summer-specific financial aid options, or pay out of pocket.\n2. [Test out of](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/advising/ICS%2031%20Credit%20by%20Exam.php) ICS 31 and into ICS 32 if you already have some CS knowledge. ICS 32 should be a little easier to enroll in as it is the second class out of the three course series.\n3. Take the equivalent of the courses at a Community College. You can go to both UCI and a CC at the same time, but I'd check with a counselor first. If you wish to do this, I'd recommend Orange Coast College as the counselors in ICS seem to really like that CC and the courses from there. You'd run into far less problems during the articulation process of receiving credit for a class completion outside of UCI.\n\nFor those with AP Computer Science exam scores:\n\n* If you scored between 1-2 or took AP Computer Science Principles, you will still need to take ICS 31.\n* If you scored between 3-5, you can choose to take the exam for credit or directly enroll in ICS 32A. ICS 32 and ICS 32A are practically the same, except that ICS 32A includes a quick crash course on Python at the beginning of the quarter.\n\nNote the exam ***only*** gives course credit for ICS 31.\n\n# Can I double major?\n\n*Yes*. Double majoring follows the exact same process as changing your major. However, there are several considerations if this is something you may be looking to do:\n\n1. UCI's majors belong to different \"Schools.\" For example, Philosophy is under the School of Humanities and Political Science is under the School of Social Science. Some Schools have their own set of requirements *in addition* to the courses already needed for your degree. Be sure to look into this if you are planning your schedule.\n2. A second major will likely require you to stay an extra year, especially if you are doing two majors in two different Schools. So those who were admitted as freshman may be looking at five years total and those admitted as transfers would be looking at three years total.\n3. If you receive financial aid, you will need to be careful about \"completing\" one major before the other as you will risk financial aid cut-off. The workaround to this is to schedule your classes in such a way so that you complete both your majors at the same time in the quarter before your graduation. In other words, leaving one or two classes in both majors for last.\n\nAnd as always, consult an academic counselor before making any important decisions.\n\n# How do I add a minor?\n\nAdding a minor is a fairly simple procedure.\n\n1. Take the courses listed under the requirements tab for the minor you're interested in. (Don't forget you can find this in the UCI Course Catalogue!) Typically, minors are six to seven courses.\n2. Make an appointment or walk-in to see an academic counselor. They will add the minor to your DegreeWorks. You can also do this at any time, even before you start taking any classes towards your minor. **I'd actually recommend doing this ASAP as your personal DegreeWorks will list all the courses you'll need to complete it.** DegreeWorks is a basically an actively updated page with a complete rundown of your academic career at UCI\u2014such as classes you've taken, your GPA, units, etc.\n3. Complete your minor before graduation to receive credit for it. You will see [a checkmark](https://i.imgur.com/8clcQQE.png) under the graduation application page if you do. Minors are only credited in your official transcript and nowhere else.\n\nTo remove or change minors at any time, simply revisit an academic counselor. It's a pretty casual process. However, keep in mind that adding a minor **does not grant you priority in registration for classes if your major does not fall under the same School as your minor!** Most classes are restricted for the first few weeks during registration windows for students in that School and only open up to all UCI students much later on *(some classes also remain completely restricted to certain Schools)*.\n\n* **Note:** If you are looking to do an ICS minor, you may run into trouble getting the classes you need due to how impacted the School is.\n\n# Do my AP credits transfer over?\n\n*Yes, they do.* Please refer to this [website](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/ap-exam-credits/ap-credits/irvine.html) for the full list of AP credits that UCI accepts.\n\n# Where do I find the current quarter's Schedule of Classes?\n\nWelcome to [WebReg](https://reg.uci.edu/)! Please look forward to a most pleasant and lovely time with your new best friend. WebReg serves as the main portal to a number of important things you'll be doing during your time as a student at UCI. It is the place to register for classes, apply for graduation, view your Unofficial Transcript, change or add a major, and much more. Over the years, you'll be visiting this place often. *Very,* ***very*** *often.*\n\n*New best friend?* New best friend.\n\nThe Schedule of Classes *(and our other best friend, the UCI General Catalogue)* can be found in the main navigational tabs.\n\n# Wait, there are entire lists of prospective courses being offered for the year?\n\nMost Schools aim to release a full list of undergraduate courses for the next academic year by the sixth week of Spring Quarter. For your convenience, I've linked each School's below (at least the ones I could find):\n\n* School of Biological Sciences: [Link](https://undergraduate.bio.uci.edu/course-offerings/)\n* School of Business: [Link](https://merage.uci.edu/_files/documents/programs/undergraduate/22-23-Tentative-MGMT-Schedule-3.pdf)\n* School of Education: [Link](https://advise.education.uci.edu/tentative-course-schedule.html)\n* School of Engineering: [Link](https://undergraduate.eng.uci.edu/advising/course-planning/)\n* School of Humanities: [Link](https://www.humanities.uci.edu/undergrad/academics/planned)\n* School of ICS: [Link](https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/courses/index-course)\n* School of Social Ecology:  [Link](https://students.soceco.uci.edu/)\n* Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences: [Link](https://pharmsci.uci.edu/course-scheduling-information/)\n\nIf you cannot find your School or major as listed above, try to do a quick search with \\[your major\\] + \\[your major's school\\] + 'UCI undergraduate course listing'. *(e.g. Urban Studies School of Social Ecology UCI undergraduate course listing.)* Some majors are handled by specific departments within the School and can only release course listings for that major rather than for all majors under the School. Others have no listing at all so if you can't find yours, there probably wasn't one created or made publicly available.\n\n# Should I major in Computer Science, Data Science, or Software Engineering?\n\n**Disclaimer: UCI is the** ***ONLY*** **UC where Computer Science is** ***NOT*** **under the same department as Engineering! It is in its own School (Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences) alongside Software Engineering and Data Science.** ^(Well, CSE technically exists, but that's a story for another day.)\n\n*Wait, what does that even mean?* Well, it means that the three majors mentioned above (and other majors within the School such as Informatics) take many of the same lower-division/core classes. In fact, the only difference between the lower-divisions needed for Computer Science and Software Engineering is a single class (ICS 53).\n\nThis also means that *all three majors* require completion of two key classes that cover fundamental topics necessary for anyone learning Computer Science\u2014and for successful (whiteboard) tech interviews *(see: LeetCode grind)*:\n\n* ICS 46: Data Structure Implementation and Analysis\n* CS 161: Design and Analysis of Algorithms\n\nSo if you were accepted for Data Science or Software Engineering, and are worried about being properly equipped with the knowledge to enter the tech field after graduation, know that you'll still be receiving almost exactly the same fundamental education as a CS major would. (And ultimately, the amount of personal projects and effort you put into preparing for tech interviews matter far more than the title of the degree.)\n\nRegarding [Data Science](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofstatistics/datascience_bs/#requirementstext): A large portion of this major consists of taking classes in Statistics. If you're a lover of Statistics, you'll feel right at home. There are also plenty of solid CS electives to choose from\u2014ranging from topics in AI to database management.\n\nRegarding [Software Engineering](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/softwareengineering_bs/#requirementstext): Software Engineering as offered at UCI is basically a specialised track/rigid version of the Computer Science major. This is because a [Computer Science](https://catalogue.uci.edu/donaldbrenschoolofinformationandcomputersciences/departmentofcomputerscience/computerscience_bs/#requirementstext) major can in fact take every class required and offered in Software Engineering for credit. However, the reverse is not true, making it impractical for someone already majoring in CS to switch to Software Engineering.\n\nA large portion of this major consists of taking core classes in IN4MTX. Some classes are extremely useful for the industry (debugging, AGILE, design patterns/refactoring, etc.) while others not so much. But given that we are edging towards opinion territory and that this thread's main purpose is to serve as a general FAQ\u2014if you'd like to know more, don't be shy about reaching out or leaving a comment below!\n\n# What are lower-division and upper-division classes?\n\nLower-division classes are:\n\n* Labeled by a number between \\[1-99\\]. *(e.g. FMS 85C)*\n* Often considered classes that teach core/fundamental concept for a major. (*e.g. ICS 31-33, a one-year track of Python programming for all ICS majors)*\n* Generally larger-sized classes (some have a max capacity of 300 students) as these classes are usually taken by students across every major to complete GE requirements.\n* All GEs are lower-division.\n\nUpper-division classes are:\n\n* Labeled by a number between \\[100-199\\]. *(e.g. PHILOS 110)*\n* Often considered classes that are more specialised/tailored to a major. *(e.g. C144, Criminal Law, a class that would count for upper-division elective credit towards the major Criminology, Law, & Society)*\n* Generally smaller-sized classes as these classes are usually only taken by those within the major or those looking to complete a minor.\n* Most major electives are upper-division.\n\n# How do I join an organisation? Frats? Clubs?\n\nThe full list can be found [here](https://campusorgs.uci.edu/). At the very top of the site, click \"Search Campus Organisations\" to look for organisations you may be interested in. This website serves as the main hub for all UCI Campus Organisations\u2014including professional organisations, frats, cultural clubs, and so on. If you're interested in creating or registering your own organisation, it'll have all the information you'll need.\n\nEvery new academic year, an event called the \"Anteater Involvement Fair\" is held during week zero of Fall Quarter. On this special day, nearly every organisation will set up their own booth in the hopes of attracting new members. It's tons of fun and I highly recommend checking it out even if you're not particularly looking to join anything. *Who knows, there might be something among the 600+ organisations just for you...*\n\n# Swagman?\n\nThe man, the myth, the legend. No one knows who he is or where he comes from. Some say a Swagman sighting grants you good luck...so be sure to keep your eyes peeled! *^(Especially during finals week!)*\n\n# Petr drops?\n\nIf you ever see a large crowd of people madly dashing across campus in a single direction, it probably means a Petr drop was announced.\n\nPetr drops are an experience purely unique to UCI. After popping up around late 2018, Petr drops have firmly rooted itself as a tradition to our school as new Petrs take up the mantle of those who have graduated before. Further explanation on its origins by one of the original Petrs is linked [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnlExXhx7F/). Also see /u/YummySpamMusubi's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/12fcv7y/comment/jff06sq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for more information and a history on Petr drops!\n\n# Activities to do in the area?\n\n~~Sometimes I imagine leaving my room.~~ *~~Oh, the absolute horror!~~*\n\nUCI is:\n\n* Just a ten minute drive from the western coastline, meaning *tons of beaches!* My personal recommendation is [Treasure Island](https://www.visitlagunabeach.com/things-to-do/beaches/treasure-island/) in Laguna Beach. Nice and clean with absolutely stunning views. *^(Even had a cousin)* *^(take their wedding photos here!)*\n* Pretty darn crazy about boba! Irvine has a serious abundance of boba shops. I swear a new one pops up every other month. And if you enjoy discovering new food, Orange County has plenty to offer!\n* Within a reasonable driving distance of three amusement parks: Disneyland (Anaheim), Knott's Berry Farm (Buena Park), and Universal Studios (Hollywood).\n* A beautiful campus with a lush and relaxing park in the center of it all. Catch a break from classes with a picnic or bring your very own hammock!\n* Also in one of the safest cities in the United States! Of course, nothing and nowhere is *completely* safe, but it's made late night studying and hangouts much more comfortable compared to... being in downtown LA, for instance. *^(Not throwing shade at a certain other UC, I promise!)*\n\nAs you may have inferred by now, having a car is a rather beneficial thing during your time at UCI... *^(except perhaps having to pay upwards of $600 a year to park, ugh)*. But high chances are that any organisations and/or events you attend will be arranging rides for those without personal means of transportation. Prior to CoVID, you could also (for a small fee) takes busses to large shopping areas such as The Irvine Spectrum or The District in Tustin. There were even stops for Diamond Jamboree, a plaza near campus with an H-Mart and a wide variety of Asian restaurants. While nothing has been officially confirmed as of yet, I hear there may be talk of reinstating these lines in the near future. ^(Or, you know, you could always leech off a friend, heh. Just be sure to return the favour with the occasional meal! Or gas money. Or a gigantic serving of ants.)\n\n# Some cool fun facts?\n\nI gotcha. Did you know:\n\n* [In N Out's headquarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger) can be seen from the main drop-off/pick-up area on campus (called \"the flagpoles\" by many students).\n* [Multiple movies](https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~rdalton/movies/ucimovies.htm) have been filmed at or near UCI, including *Ocean's Eleven (2001)*, *Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972)*, and *Poltergeist (1982)*. A new, upcoming movie directed by and starring Jerry Seinfield was [recently filmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/vm3gk5/university_of_kelloggs_irvine/) at the flagpoles.\n* Conan O'Brien [has visited us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eobtp2G7d7o)!\n* President Obama (at the time) [gave a commencement speech](https://time.com/4341811/obama-commencement-speech-transcript-university-of-california-irvine/) during UCI's 50th anniversary.\n* We have no football team. *Why is that?* Well, because we chose to [build a science library](https://newuniversity.org/2009/11/23/the-debate-on-football-at-uci-2/) instead! Rumours say that the architects of the library were die-hard *Star Trek* fans and [modeled the building after the USS Enterprise](https://newuniversity.org/2017/02/28/life-on-ring-road-the-allure-of-ayala/).\n* UCI is one of the only universities to have their very own [eSports Arena (PC Bang)](https://esports.uci.edu/arena/) on campus. Scholarships are offered for those on the *League of Legends* or *Overwatch* varsity teams. *(Not to mention, the amount of notable figures in the LoL community that have attended UCI over the years!)*\n* R.I.P. Kobe Bryant. He was known [to frequent UCI's gym](https://ucirvinesports.com/news/2020/8/24/general-kobeday-remembering-kobe-bryant), the ARC (Anteater Recreation Center). *(Check it out when/if you're a student. After all, it's included as part of the tuition fees you pay every quarter!)* Kobe joined pick-up games, inspired both fans and aspiring athletes alike, and left everyone who was lucky enough to meet him with an amazing and wholesome experience.\n\n# Additional Resources\n\nSince this thread can't possibly cover everything (and I certainly don't know everything!), I've included a few links below to other helpful/important resources:\n\n* Academic Advising Offices: [Link](https://academicadvising.uci.edu/offices/)\n* Parking Permits: [Link](https://parking.uci.edu/)\n* Anteater Express: [Link](https://shuttle.uci.edu/)\n* Housing: [Link](https://housing.uci.edu/)\n* Campuswide Honors Collegium: [Link](https://honors.uci.edu/)\n* Financial Aid: [Link](https://www.ofas.uci.edu/)\n* Tuition and Fees: [Link](https://www.reg.uci.edu/fees/)\n* LGBT+ Resource Center: [Link](https://lgbtrc.uci.edu/)\n* International Students: [Link](https://ic.uci.edu/)\n* Counseling Center: [Link](https://counseling.uci.edu/)\n\nAs mentioned at the beginning of this thread, please don't hesitate to use the comment section below if you have anything you want to ask or say!\n\n*And a special shoutout to* /u/YummySpamMusubi *for all the wonderful help and advice given to fellow Anteaters throughout the years!*", "title": "Current & Incoming Students FAQ Megathread", "id": "12fcv7y", "score": 59, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/12fcv7y/current_incoming_students_faq_megathread/", "permalink": "/r/UCI/comments/12fcv7y/current_incoming_students_faq_megathread/", "comments": [{"id": "jff06sq", "body": "Great post packed full of information!\n\nA few more links that will be handy:\n\n* List of [Academic Advising Offices](https://academicadvising.uci.edu/offices/)\n* [Quarterly Academic Calendar 2023-24](https://www.reg.uci.edu/calendars/quarterly/2023-2024/quarterly23-24.html) for all deadlines and dates related to adding, dropping, and changing classes.\n* Question about when something is open at UCI?

The fact that a CS major has more flexibility than a SE major does not necessarily make one major \"better\" than the other. As I explain in this post, both majors share every single fundamental/core requirement with the exception of one class so you won't be missing out on any fundamental CS knowledge you'll need for success in the field.\n2. Some classes that the SE track requires you to take are extremely beneficial when it comes to the professional industry. For example, you'll be introduced to concepts such as AGILE/scrum which are project management systems that every well-established tech company uses. You'll also learn how to properly design and document code.\n3. There is literally no difference between having a CS/Software Engineering degree when applying to tech jobs. While you can argue that CS is \"better\" simply because they have access to a wider range of classes/topics, much of your future success in the tech industry is almost (if not completely) dependent on you as an individual. Most classes are not going to teach you how to use advanced git, shell tools and scripting, metaprogramming, and much more. And they are certainly not going to make up for the hours of grind in Leetcode, system design concepts, and personal projects you'll need if you want a job at a top tech company. I took classes on Java and C++ as my fundamentals as a SE major just like any other CS major did\u2014yet what I have to do for three projects this quarter has absolutely nothing to do with any of those: I'm working with [ASP.NET](https://ASP.NET) Core, Ruby on Rails, Angular, and C# for the first time ever. I come from a heavy Humanities/Social Science background and you'll learn quickly in CS that professors often aren't there to teach as much as they are to act as a guide/mentor. This isn't saying there aren't excellent instructors, but programming is best learned with hands-on experience. You'll constantly be picking up new skills, Googling, and researching on your own\u2014things that no class or major will ever do for you in full.\n\nHope this helps in easing some of your worries!", "score": 4, "author": "Aveldaheilt"}, {"id": "jge95n8", "body": "I was too... what have people been saying lol", "score": 1, "author": "djinn-jj"}, {"id": "ji5oegp", "body": "my fav prof is dr. zinger! def recommended taking at least one class with her :)", "score": 2, "author": "xtluna09"}, {"id": "jfurc7t", "body": "I can't speak to UCSD personally as I don't know anything about the school, but I'm glad to share my experience as someone who has been at UCI for an extensive amount of time.\n\nI'm not exactly sure about UCI being less difficult than UCSD. That seems to vary largely from major to major. Either way, I'd say that the difficulty of the academic experience shouldn't really play a part when choosing between schools\u2014what you get out of college is what you put in. UCI boasts plenty of opportunities and they're not hard to find as long as you're just a tad more proactive than the typical student. For example, there are emails sent almost on a daily basis by each department that offer research positions, workshops, or even job opportunities and much more.\n\nAs for UCI being socially dead, I'd again reiterate that what you get out of college is what you put in. I've been a transfer/commuter my entire university life, but I was able to put myself out there, attend organisations/events, and have a blast of a time. In fact, my closest group of friends were people who have been dorming together since freshman year (and some even knew each other since high school). They're now my lifelong friends and I'm glad that I was able to meet them as a fresh transfer in my junior year. Now I'm the furthest thing possible from an extrovert, but I also didn't want to be someone who simply went to classes and went back home.

{"subreddit": "CSULB", "body": "**BIGGEST DISCLAIMER:** \n\n***Financial Aid is on a case by case basis***. ***Reddit will not be able to answer your questions unless they are in the greatest broad terms***. **What works for one person may not apply to you. The financial aid office exists for a reason, their staff is there for a reason.**\n\nYou will receive a lot of helpful anecdotal stories through reddit, but it is your job as a responsible student and adult to call the Financial Aid office 562-985-8403 to make sure your question is answered correctly and specifically to you. The longest call I have ever been was about 30 minutes with the shortest being 2 minutes. You can also set up an in person appointment using the [join the queue](https://kiosk.na1.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/10000000110) option if you need to go more depth into your questions. These are basic answers to broad and basic questions that keep being asked.\n\n***What is financial aid and how do I apply? Minimum classes I need to take?***\n\n[This](https://www2.calstate.edu/attend/paying-for-college/financial-aid). Read it and use it to apply if you need to. You can also scheduled a meeting with a financial aid advisor [here](https://kiosk.na1.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/10000000110) to talk about the process. If you are an undocumented person or AB540 student you can apply for aid and the middle class family scholarship, I would recommend reaching out to the Dream Success Center (562-985-5587) and financial aid as well. The minimum classes you need to take is 12 units worth and maintain at least a 2.0 grade average less you go on probation.\n\n***When is my financial aid posting? Why have I not gotten my aid yet?***\n\nFinancial aid should be posting around now all the way till the end of July and even until August. This depends on the academic program you are in. Some students received their aid packets all the way in early may (graduates). If you are unsure or are worried about your potential financial aid packet call financial aid to see what the current state of your packet is.\n\n***What happens if my financial aid doesn't cover all my tuition?***\n\nIf your aid doesn't cover all your tuition you have to go big brain time and calculate it yourself. You will subtract your aid from your tuition . You will pay whatever is left over up front so that you are not dropped from your classes. If you can not pay whatever is left up front you can set up payment plans on mycsulb (more info [here](https://www.csulb.edu/enrollment-services/student-financial-services-how-to-guides#how-to-enroll-in-a-payment-plan)) or you can go to the bursars office on the first floor of brotman hall and set it up in person.\n\n***What happens to the extra money? Can I spend it however I want?***\n\nAny extra money over tuition/board will be mailed to you in the form of a check if you have not set a direct deposit to your bank account. You may spend it however you like, you are an adult. If it runs out you won't be getting any until the next semester so that's on you. Some scholarships like the bookstore scholarship will only allow you to use it at certain locations and certain things so do keep that in mind?\n\n***Why am I getting only loans?***\n\nIf you have received only loans, when you usually get financial aid it usually means you did not qualify based on you and your parents income. Records look back two years so (2018). If there was a drastic change in income since then (death or parent/loss of job) call the financial aid office and file an [income appeal](https://es-forms.es.csulb.edu/forms/2021_FSOPRJ.php). This **DOES NOT** guarantee you get aid but is the first step forward. Make sure to call the financial aid office first to make sure there is no error on their part.\n\n***Subsidized loans vs Unsubsidized loans? Should I take both?***\n\n***Subsidized:*** You will not incur interest while you are still enrolled in school. In most cases the government pays the interest on this loan. **Unsubsidized:** Interest will start to incur as soon as the loan is taken out/ disbursed.\n\nAs for which is better? Subsidized loans are more beneficial to you because you don't need to pay back right away, but unsubsidized loans are usually larger and can cover more expenses. More information can be found [here](https://www.csulb.edu/financial-aid/loan-information) in addition thing such as loan forgiveness if you choose a public service/teacher route.\n\n***Will COVID affect financial aid? Will it affect me in the fall?***\n\nYes, it already has and probably not. Their have already been deductions. The CSU system lost 6 million in aid this summer alone. Is there anything concrete for fall? Unknown at this point. Keep your eyes open for any info coming forward.\n\nAs you can see, in all these questions, calling financial aid (562-985-8403) is pretty much your go to answer to make sure you know where you stand in financial Aid.

I got into UCM for Computer Science and Engineering and got into UCSC for Computer Science. I wanted to be a game developer but chose computer science to broaden my job opportunities and I know there are some issues with the game dev industry.\n\nSome pros I found for UCM are the student-to-faculty ratio, new facilities, the clubs, and the small population. But some cons are that the food and location suck. The food was on the news for how bad it was, but it seemed better when I visited. I don't plan on leaving campus much but I imagine the location makes it hard to find job opportunities. Their Computer Science also isn't ranked that high compared to the other UCs. As far as game development I saw that UCM has a game development club, game jams, and a course in game programming. UCM is also a growing school so it'll only get better.\n\nSome pros for UCSC are the close proximity to silicon valley for job opportunities, the beautiful campus, and the computer science is ranked a bit higher. Their game development program is also highly ranked. The cons I see are the cost and how hard it is to get housing. My friends are also going to UCM, two of which are doing the same major as me, while at UCSC I'd have no one. \n\nSo for UC Merced, what are the job opportunities like for Computer Science?

A lot of it depends on you esp in CSE, so unlike other majors your school specifically doesn't make much of a difference(this is one of the reasons I picked Merced over UIUC).    \n\n\nMost professors care a lot about your education but classes are not necessarily the most rigorous compared to other schools(im comparing in general not UCSC I don't know about how their classes are). That being said most are willing to go above and beyond if you go to office hours and more.  I will say for game dev specifically UCSC is more known, however people's interests can change. A friend of mine was dead set on Game-Dev but now they've moved over to do AI/ML stuff.   \n\n\nJob Opportunities: It all depends on you! I've been luckily enough to get 2 CS internships(one at Nasa this summer, and one last year at SAP) and I know some other people have gotten some good ones, but again its all on you. Companies don't just look at your school and go heres an internship.   \n\n\nKnowing people at your school coming in is a plus, but usually isn't something thats make or break.  UC Merced is a smaller campus(only 10 mins to get from one side to the other walking).

You see, I\u2019m from a conservative area near San Diego and I happen to be a staunch conservative. I'm also a registered Republican.\n\nI believe in small, limited government; limited interference in the private sector and deregulation, i.e. free markets; pro-life policy; supporting the NRA and gun rights; the fact that climate change claims are way overblown; not being ashamed of my heritage; lowered taxes; curbing illegal immigration; and putting America First, etc.\n\nI\u2019m also an avid listener of podcasts and shows hosted by Ben Shapiro (my favorite), Steven Crowder, Dennis Prager, Michael Knowles, Andrew Klavan, Charlie Kirk, Jordan Peterson\u2026 the list goes on and on.\n\nNow, given that my views are right-wing, my question is: If I wore t-shirts to class and around campus that with messages such as, \"Facts don\u2019t care about your feelings\u201d or \u201cReagan Bush \u201884\u201d or \u201cSocialism Sucks\u201d or a \u201cCapitalism\u201d but in the style and font of the 'Coca-Cola' logo, would I be attacked for my views? Would I be singled out, scorned or ostracized by students who can\u2019t stand the fact that someone disagrees with their left-wing worldview? In other words, I refer to the hard line leftists who are common on every college campus -- the type of students who draw consistently on either emotion or logical fallacy instead of air-tight, sound arguments to present their positions like most on the right. You all know who I'm talking about, the students who tend to major in gender studies, ethnic studies or sociology. Now, I'm not insulting those fields; rather, I'm merely saying that they tend to attract individuals with particular political inclinations. I also believe these fields help entrench these extreme left-wing views in students. Simply, I want to know if these individuals will give me hard time for my openly conservative views.\n\nI also ask because I tend not to shy away from correcting liberal professors when they try to proselytize their left-wing socialist views in class. I did it all through high school and was known as the kid who wouldn\u2019t back down from an intellectual scuffle with my leftist teachers. At one point I even had to have a mediation in the vice-principal's office with my AP government teacher who couldn\u2019t get over the fact that I didn\u2019t buy his \u201ctax cuts are terrible for the economy myth.\" This was after it got pretty heated one day between us in class. Long story short, I agreed to no longer bring my \u201cliberal tears\u201d coffee mug to class every morning lest I set him off again, haha. But boy, was he full of rhetoric and baseless arguments. It was honestly kind of sad. It\u2019s just too bad my peers didn\u2019t see it. I actually should've kept quiet most of the time because I ran the risk of being graded unfairly and thus risking my position as one of my school's valedictorians. Luckily, it wasn't an issue. But the fact that I had to worry about it at all tells you a lot about the state of left-wing bias in schools these days: it's everywhere, especially in colleges.\n\nAnyway, I would just like to know what kind of an experience a proud conservative freshman would have, given these viewpoints and predilections. Based on the fact that UCLA is the top public university in the nation and attracts bright students, I don\u2019t expect to encounter many (if any) students who would do anything drastic, but you can never be too safe. Even schools like Yale have leftists who scram at professors and get away with it. That\u2019s why I inquire opinions on how the political climate is at the moment and what I can expect in the fall.\n\nAlso, how\u2019s the Republican club on campus? I honestly can\u2019t wait to join. Btw, if any kooky far-leftists are reading this: get ready because UCLA is about to produce another Ben Shapiro. \ud83d\ude09 You\u2019ve been warned, lol.

By and large, what you learn in any business program isn't exactly what you'll be doing for a career, which is true of every field and it's why your major isn't a job preparation program.", "score": 3, "author": "The_Archer_of_Rohan"}, {"id": "jes63wg", "body": "Similar situation - USC Marshall and UCLA, but I\u2019m wondering about career prospects", "score": 2, "author": "fedyashl27"}, {"id": "jet08fj", "body": "u/BarrenWuffett2008 you're obviously a very intelligent person, so therefore, I don't think it's wise to take the comments here as truth regarding UCLA.\n\nLet's dispel a few myths that pervade UCLA's Reddit board -- I'm multi-tasking, so I'll probably be prone towards mistakes, hopefully just grammatical:\n\n\\-- **UCLA students have a hard time registering for classes.** This is true for some majors like Psychology and Bio Sciences because there are a good number of these majors on campus, and in the latter, primarily in the pre-health lower-division classes where classes are pooled for all the Life Sciences, and also generally for freshmen. But for most everyone else, it's not hard to get classes.\n\n\\-- **UCLA students are complainers**. Based on Reddit it's obvious they would be, but I think it's this forum that is drawing a lot of these students. With Reddit, as in any forum,  one has to take the good by wading through the bad. The Management and Economics departments often incur the wrath of Reddit posters (but I think there are a bunch of UCB and USC lurkers here).\n\n\\-- **UCLA is a tough-grading, ultra-competitive school where grade deflations exists.** Not true, [the average gpa of a baccalaureate recipient was 3.59 in 2021-22](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/11qrpl2/here_are_2022_ucla_baccalaureate_gpas_by_time_to/). The students at the University are actually very collaborative. The capstone projects will often, mostly be collaborative projects. I think what would be good is if Bizecon were a capstone major project with outside companies. But if one is diligent in taking internships, then one should place very well.\n\n\\-- **The Economics/Management courses are extremely harsh grading.** [If it's not really true for the Engineering department](https://registrar.ucla.edu/registration-classes/graduation/final-degree-audit/honors) \\-- about .07 of a gpa difference in its 80th percentile grads compared to L&S -- it wouldn't be true of Economics. I think where they get this idea is, e.g., from a financial modeling class like Management 142A, where the curve is high because the professor requires every detail be correct for what would be easy exercises. What students from this class have to understand is that you can't submit mistake-ridden financial reports. Classes 142B & C will have progressively harder exercises of course.\n\n\\-- **UC Lotsa Accountants,** based off of a USC/UCB uninformed Reddit post of the past. This is false. Besides, USC, UCSB, and the Cal States probably produce most of the accountant types in CA at present, with UCLA producing a decent amount. The *lotsa accountants* notion might have been true at one point in the past, but the Bizecon major is now extremely varied in its job placements with consulting, Banking/Investments -- I purposely reversed the order, but UCLA places well in IB with internships, internships, internships -- and marketing, with all improving now that Bizecon and Econ majors are adding things like Stats, Specialization in Computing, or Data Science Engineering/ Social Data Science) to the major.  So they're going quant if not specifically related to quant-trading.\n\nUCLA doesn't offer marketing except for a few courses in Communications, and consequently those wanting this field major in Comm, Sociology, and/or Psychology. Some students are attracted more by pure Economics, and Quant Econ should really blow up at UCLA; I'm hoping at least.\n\n[Economics](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=economics) has a lot of class offerings for its varied concentrations with numerous classes outside of its typical realm. Here is the [Management](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=management) side.\n\nUCLA is really a pleasant place to attend as it's in the best part of LA, and the beach is only five miles away. Undoubtedly, this is why it attracts people from all over the world as well as the other 49 states.\n\nEdit: If you or the others have any other specific questions, please pose them and others or myself will undoubtedly answer.

Most of the graduates were at *3+ to 4 years* in attaining 180(+) units in spring of 2022, and additionally in attaining the units to satisfy their major(s), and were in the high-school graduating cohort of 2018, meaning that's when they entered UCLA, which would be right around four years in completing their degrees. This was 54.4% of the entire graduating class which included transfers, and of just those who entered from high school they were 87% of the graduating class. This doesn't mean that 87% graduated in four years; that number was 84.5% who took their degrees at the max of four years (again, of those who entered from HS and from the 2018 cohort).\n\nThe question, as related to what you're asking could be: How would that 3.59 average at graduation for the whole class relate just to life-science/bio grads? Most of the grads are in Letters & Science (L&S) and Bio is in L&S. As related to [Latin Honors](https://registrar.ucla.edu/registration-classes/graduation/final-degree-audit/honors) which is calculated to the thousandth in gpa and awards these three honors to the top 20% of the graduating class, L&S would be somewhere in the middle of all of UCLA's colleges and schools in ascendant gpas. But, again, L&S is the largest of colleges, and there are a good number of Bio students at UCLA, so it would appear that Bio majors could or should uphold the \\~3.59 average. But then, it could actually be higher because if a group of students maintain a lower gpa in their first couple of years, they may opt out of Bio and switch to, say, the social sciences.\n\nAssuming the points above are relatable, if you factor in Latin Honors into the mix (and LH is calculated to the thousandth of gpa), a good 20% of Bio majors would have \u2265 3.881 (3.88) gpa at graduation, per the lowest gpa of Cum Laude honors for L&S. This would seemingly imply, assuming a normal curve, that the 70th percentile grads would have \u2265 3.80 gpa, and it might dip to \\~ 68th percentile. But the average for Bio-related majors could be higher than the class average too as per above, as Bio majors could be majorly culled. So I'd say that a good 1/3 of the graduating Bio Sciences class would have at least a 3.8 gpa.\n\nIt doesn't appear that UCLA has grade deflation but it wouldn't have the inflation that is seemingly seen at some of the Ivy colleges.", "score": 8, "author": "noclouds82degrees", "page_title": "Reddit - Dive into anything"}, {"id": "jd72c74", "body": "No, grading has been fair from my experience, if not inflated.

Unfortunately, upper-level banking is mainly a male domain, and marketing is mainly female, at least at UCLA, but not to leave out those who identify with neither or both gender(s).\n\nThere will be some who say these numbers lag behind UCB Haas and other universities that have undergrad b-majors, but most of the upper-tier universities don't have an undergrad b-major.\n\nif UCLA students put themselves out there, by joining clubs and taking numerous internships, etc., then they'll have the same opportunities as Haas grads, but UCB students hype Haas like no other which leads to much of its blind following. Additionally, gaining internships will often be a function of scholarship in the classes students have taken as well as whom one knows, which is why being in a frat or sorority will help with ins and connections in various b-sectors.\n\nAlso, some complain that UCLA's business-related clubs are too exclusive, but that would be anywhere. However, there are clubs like the Undergraduate Business Society,  largest club on campus, which will take anyone as will Bruin Real Estate Association (BREA), which is mainly more for those interested in commercially based RE. These will have meetings and newsletters to give students notice.\n\nAs to what u/studson721 stated, the graduate-based management schools at many schools offer undergrads the opportunity to *transfer* into an undergrad business major, some with concentrations. UCLA's management school, the Anderson School of Management (ASM), has chosen to detach itself from the University, but it offers undergrads [various courses](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=management) as the *business*, or management, side of the Business Economics major.\n\nThe [Economics](https://registrar.ucla.edu/academics/course-descriptions?search=economics) side would have the typical macro- /microeconomics and econometrics, but the department has added courses almost yearly. I'm seeing some lower-div personal finance classes which weren't there before.  There are the 10 106A, B, ... V classes that offer things fairly outside of the typical economics offering.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of Economics, Business Economics, and Mathematics/ Economics majors are adding things like Statistics as a double or minor to their studies, and this is helping them become even more marketable. Econ and Bizecon are short to fairly short majors, so Stats is a good addition.\n\nSome are even adding a Specialization in Computing offering which has Java and Python, or some are now adding the Social Data Science or Data Science Engineering minors.\n\nThere are natural minors to the three majors, E, BE, ME, in Accounting and Entrepreneurship. But these two minors can be added to any major in any department, and I've heard of Sociology majors adding Accounting, and Communications, Biology, History majors, any major, adding Entrepreneurship.\n\nI've also heard of Bizecon majors adding math, or just going with one of the various Mathematics majors. There are some who are getting jobs at PwC or Deloitte who are majoring in Cognitive Science.

That's an indicator that the Bus Econ major isn't cutting it on the quantitative front.\n\nLet me try this again, but I'll try to be more concise, etc., because I don't know if I went too long, or if I exceeded terms of posting content, or whatever it was; and as you can see, what I wrote was deleted not by me but by the mods, which is fine.\n\nBut I would like to explain that your post was too simplistic or too black-and-white, cut-and-dried, discrete of outcomes, and too determinative: it isn't whether Bizecon isn't adequate in the business sphere by itself (implied) or not adequate as seen by it needing to add quant, or that quant-based jobs are not hiring BE grads who add these other majors, minors, etc. Your narrowing things down to just quant isn't just what these students are seeking by adding these minors and concentrations.\n\nIf one considers that each prospective employer is unique, then one sees why each firm's/company's hiring managers, partners, HR people, et al., are all trying to find candidates to employ that would do well at their firms or companies. If this attitude is taken, then BE, E, ME, or pure Business wouldn't be \"cutting it\" on a pure educational and preparation standpoint because a BS/BA degree is more generally based instead having a narrow specificity as to a particular company/firm, which besides, would be impossible.\n\nThis is why internships in the all-encompassing sphere of business are so important. And that's why I've recommended that those who want to enter whatever business sector take as many internships as possible, even after this person graduates if needed, so that this student or grad can find one's calling and for the prospective employer to find the right employee fit on the firm's /company's side.\n\nAll I was saying for BE, E, or ME majors to do was to add some of these minors and concentrations to be able to fit whatever mold specific companies are seeking and to be armed with the tools that they provide.\n\nAdditionally, Economics and sometimes Accounting are very important coursework that pure business majors will include in their studies, and you'll find that they are required to take macro, micro and elementary accounting.\n\nThere are some economists who could foretell that banks and the markets would have trouble with the fed tinkering with rates and funds that came true wrt to the banks and hopefully won't come to pass wrt the markets, so an overview of economic conditions affecting one's firm/company is imperative.\n\nAnd accounting is essential for accounting, obviously, and for finance. There's a famous Reddit post called U See Lotsa Accountants, using the approximate acronym of the University written by, I'm guessing, a USC or UCB grad -- I don't know when it originated, but this person was denigrating what ASM and the Economics department were offering and that they were only preparing students for accounting. It was a stupid post because accounting is essential for the broad world of finance.\n\nAnyway, adding things like the DS minors, accounting, computing specialization, value investing, entrepreneurship, are to prepare BE, E, ME grads for the very broad world of business, and to help them to be marketable in various business sectors, more so that they could choose what field in which they want to be employed, not that specifically BE is particularly lacking and their having to add these courses. And the purpose of BE is not to get a job, but to get a really good one, which it enables those who major in it to do.\n\nI'd like to see UCLA add a marketing minor, and, say, house it in Communications. I'd like to see UCLA add a few RE classes, and a few more finance-related ones, but accounting is sufficient for this latter, as well as the 142 A-C classes. In fact these three classes were added because of student input, I believe. But, also, most of the top-tier universities in the country don't have pure Business majors.", "score": 2, "author": "noclouds82degrees"}, {"id": "jdlkl16", "body": ">That's an indicator that the Bus Econ major isn't cutting it on the quantitative front.\n\nYou got all that from what I wrote? There are lots of Business Economics and Economics majors who are not adding Stats, Math, Accounting, etc., and they're going into various bus sectors in numerous capacities. Additionally, there are Bio and Polisci majors who are going into consulting, and there are Comm and Soc majors who are going into marketing. I know a Sociology grad who is working for one of the big three consulting firms, partly in whom she knew. And she's doing very well.\n\nReal estate marketing and finance are not needful of a degree in RE nor are they needful of a Business, Marketing, Econ, or Bizecon degree, especially if one starts out, say, in brokerage house in Commercial RE. I have friends who are in the field  who majored in history, sociology, and polisci, off their internships, and a lot of it is their marketing abilities and in whom they know, as it is essentially a fraternity and extremely male dominated. Then there are Residential RE brokers/agents who majored in Art History or French or anything else, and much of this is female-based.\n\nEventually some of these persons might want to get into the financing and investing within developmental RE with their own inventory of, say, land, and/or for clients, and it's something they learn in being employed in the field.\n\nEveryone says that to get into IB major is not important, but more in whom one knows, and getting to know people is often dependent on being in clubs, both the inclusive and exclusive ones, and being in a house can help. Of course, there is the sell-side and the buy-side, with the latter being more technical within finance.\n\nAdditionally, accounting is essential for non-marketing-based finance because an analyst needs to be able to read financial statements to be able to project future events of companies from an external point of view, and budgeting if this person is working internally. This is why a lot of UCLA students who want to get into the this field major in Econ or Bizecon and minor in accounting. They could go to work for an accounting firm, or they could go for a financial analyst position, but some of the big-five in accounting are going into consulting and other fields.\n\nAnd as I stated before, the accounting classes ASM offers undergrads is not only for that profession but is also for financial modeling, so the idea that these management classes are \"just a few accounting and finance courses added mainly to economics\" is pretty erroneous or however you worded things, and I noted the 10 106 A-V courses, in addition to entrepreneurial classes too. There are > 100 offerings in upper-div Economics, and they've added the Value Investing program also.\n\nEconomics is needed as a foundation of business on a macro level, where there are predictive trends that affect, e.g., investments. There are a good number of people who predicted with the Fed's interest rate hikes that the banks would be in trouble which has come to pass, and some have predicted a possible stock market collapse, which hopefully doesn't.\n\nBy making a grad more marketable by adding stats, math, etc., to Econ, Bizecon, and Math/Econ, it's showing that this person is undoubtedly  an analytical thinker; it's not that this person needs these add-ons to be employed. Bizecon, Econ and Math/Econ majors are undoubtedly naturally wired this way, but it helps to add a Stats or whatever major to openly show that this person is analytical, which should project to problem-solving ability and deep thinking.\n\nAdditionally, the top schools in the nation pretty much do not have undergraduate business programs, and their grads are doing well in getting into Goldman Sachs or wherever else.

Getting involved in student activism! One issue or another, like with most (if not, all) UC's, UC Davis has always been recognized as one of the leading UC's in student advocacy, and that means there are more than plenty activities to start.

He previously lived in Oakland, where he played high-school football and ran track. He also aspired to become a doctor, according to an online profile for a medical internship in which he described \u201chow health care can be fun.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cMaybe people think it\u2019s boring or it\u2019s scary if you\u2019re a surgeon and you see all that blood, but saving someone\u2019s life makes you feel good about yourself,\u201d Reales said.\u00a0\n\nReales declined an interview request Thursday from The Davis Enterprise.\n\nEarlier Thursday, police erected crime-scene tape on Hawthorn Lane south of West Eighth Street. Police Chief Darren Pytel confirmed it is Reales\u2019 residence, which lies a short walk from all three stabbing scenes.\n\nHis arrest sent a wave of relief through the Davis Police Department, which extended officers\u2019 shifts and called in dozens more personnel from surrounding law-enforcement agencies to safeguard an anxious community and solve the city\u2019s unprecedented crime spree.\u00a0\n\nPytel said Reales \u201cphysical evidence that was apparent on him\u201d at the time he was detained, including biological evidence. A pat-down revealed a large double-edged knife that \u201cwas consistent with the knife we were looking for from the first crime.\u201d\n\nPytel said detectives continue to investigate the motive for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a significant amount of work being done, including analyzing all the evidence that\u2019s being collected today,\u201d as well as DNA, fingerprint and fiber comparisons, Pytel said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe events leading to Reales\u2019 arrest began at about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday when a man walking through Sycamore Park spotted him sitting alone on the children\u2019s playground.\u00a0\n\nWith shoulder-length wavy hair, and wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and black Adidas track pants, he bore a strong resemblance to the suspect seen fleeing the L Street stabbing scene.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe made eye contact with me and came toward me rather briskly,\u201d said the witness, who asked to remain anonymous. He said he backed off at that point but \u201ckept an eye on him\u201d as Reales wandered through the park, then through the neighborhood east of it.\n\n\u201cHe was walking around sort of aimlessly, which I though was odd,\u201d said the witness, who continued following the person from a distance to The Marketplace shopping center, where he briefly lost sight of him. Reales later emerged from a store and walked back toward the park area.\n\nThe witness said he called police multiple times as he tracked Reales, ultimately flagging down an officer heading westbound on Villanova Drive toward the park. Reales began walking more briskly at that point but never tried to run.\u00a0\n\nAdditional police units responded to the scene, bringing numerous residents outside to watch the commotion. Reales, who was cuffed initially, left unrestrained with police shortly after 5 p.m.\n\nPolice cautioned at the time that Reales was not placed under arrest, but rather volunteered to accompany officers to the Davis police station in order to give a statement.\n\nWednesday\u2019s tips added to hundreds police have received over the past week, reporting people who matched the suspect\u2019s description and other suspicious activity being observed.\u00a0\n\nThe description first emerged early Sunday, after a witness who interrupted the attack on Najm in Sycamore Park briefly followed the suspect as he left the stabbing scene with Najm\u2019s bicycle.\n\nWitnesses to the L Street assault, and the victim himself, offered similar descriptions following that incident. One man said he saw the suspect lurking among some nearby trees some two hours before the stabbing.\n\n\u201cWe asked the community to provide tips, and they delivered, meaningfully,\u201d Pytel said. \u201cThat has to be recognized,\u201d along with the law-enforcement teams he said worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to solve the case.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nReales remains in Yolo County Jail custody on a no-bail hold, his arraignment likely taking place early next week in Yolo Superior Court.\n\nA 2020 graduate of Castlemont High School in Oakland, Reales spent the summer of 2017 as an intern at the West Oakland Health Center, and the summer before at Mentoring in Medicine and Science (MIMS), also in Oakland, according to his LinkedIn profile.\u00a0\n\nThe Oakland Health Pathways Partnership \u2014 a collaboration among the Oakland Unified School District, Alameda Health System and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency \u2014\u00a0featured Reales prominently on its website, where he said wanted to \u201cgive back to the community\u201d as a doctor.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI got into health care to help my grandmother \u2014 she has type 2 diabetes,\u201d Reales said. \u201cMy grandmother used to take care of me when I was young, and now I take care of her. I\u2019m the oldest in my family. My parents work, so I take care of my younger brother and sister, take them to school. I help with the cooking and cleaning.\n\n\u201cMIMS introduced me to connections with people and a network of hospitals,\u201d added Reales, who toured several hospitals as part of the program. \u201cI saw how health care can be fun. Maybe people think it\u2019s boring or it\u2019s scary if you\u2019re a surgeon and you see all that blood, but saving someone\u2019s life makes you feel good about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reach Lauren Keene at lkeene@davisenterprise.net.

In a survey we did of r/UCSD, 2/3 respondents agreed r/UCSD didn't represent UCSD's overall student body. \n\n# A few useful links:\n\n* [The New Student Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cVRH3wrEK3RQ5OZ9cLyPYhzUTtlkNlxq5W9QEIr_CwM/edit?fbclid=IwAR3EwJJxHZsGClKT65_eI_C8a2vsp0yPtdOX9zH6K9he6SQ-vTVBgqJqsik)\n* [UCSD Incoming Student FAQ - The Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IBOha62mF0onJOq-f5FuGR4MdNZDLZwhR1GnSrnA1es/edit)\n* Discord Servers\n   * [Class of 2027 Discord](https://discord.gg/HCPwmKhXgB)\n   * [Class of 2025 Discord]( https://discord.gg/6rGpBksv5S)\n   * Additional servers can be found through the [UCSD Discord Servers MegaDoc](https://ucsd.edu/go/discord) after getting your UCSD email. \n* [TritonLink](https://students.ucsd.edu/)\n* [UCSD Support](https://support.ucsd.edu/services)\n* [UCSD Admissions](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/)\n* [r/UCSD Copypasta Archive (need to start the meme indoctrination early)](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/wiki/copypasta)\n* [4 Year Plans](http://plans.ucsd.edu)\n\nPlease be aware stuff at UCSD can change *fast*. Most info you can find on this subreddit will still hold true, but there were some major changes in 2020 (Sixth College has a brand new location, Seventh College exists where transfers used to live, transfers moved to a different area).\n\nEighth College is brand new for Fall 2023, with its housing still currently being under construction. As a result, we don't have as much specific info about it besides the GE requirements and the location. \n\n# How do I login to check my admissions decision?\n\nYou should be logging into the [Admissions Portal](https://beatriton.ucsd.edu/account/login). This is different from all the stuff current students use. If you can't login, email [slatehelp@ucsd.edu](mailto:slatehelp@ucsd.edu).\n\n# Can I switch to Computer Science? / I was accepted undeclared but I applied CS!:\n\nIf you were not accepted directly into CSE:CS or CSE:CE (not ECE:CE) and are dead set on being a CS major, you should not attend UCSD. Being admitted undeclared basically means you were accepted to UCSD, but the CSE department rejected your application. Switching into CS is now effectively impossible. The CSE department does not anticipate there being ANY slots for current UCSD students to switch into. More details can be found on the [CSE Capped Major Webpage](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse-capped-admissions-program). *Assume it will be impossible to switch into Computer Science if you were not directly admitted to the major.*\n\n~~Computer Engineering is a bit different, CSE CE and ECE CE are the exact same major requirements (only the advisors are different), but ECE CE is subject to the ECE capped major system (which is not a lottery but requires a high GPA in the screening courses) while CSE CE is subject to the CSE system. So if you are okay with CE instead of CS, you can try going for ECE:CE. It will still be challenging and is far from guaranteed.~~ \n\n[**EDIT: ECE CE WILL NO LONGER BE AN OPTION AND IS EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE AS WELL.** ](https://ece.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/capped-major-status)\n\nIf you are set on UCSD but not set on CS, the [Computing Paths page](http://computingpaths.ucsd.edu/) lists other computing related majors that UCSD has such as Math-CS, Cognitive Science, Data Science, etc (but keep in mind these are NOT CS).\n\n# What does the college I got affect? Can I change college? \n\nFor freshman admits, your college is basically only going to affect your GE requirements and where you're likely to live on campus (although you can be overflowed to other housing depending on space). For transfers, it's only GE requirements as there is separate transfer housing. As a result, it affects basically nothing for transfers since most have IGETC and will have very few GEs coming in.\n\nYour major is entirely disconnected from your college (there are even separate major advisors who work for your department separate from your college advisors who work for your college). Your classes will be held all over campus and have a mix of students from all colleges. You can eat at any dining hall, the colleges are basically all directly next to each other and easy to get between, you will probably make friends in all sorts of different colleges. The furthest apart two colleges are is about a 20-25 minute walk (Seventh to the future site of Eighth). \n\nYou cannot easily change college. You will need to complete at least part of your original college's writing sequence (meaning it will take about a year to even meet the application requirements) and be able to prove you can graduate two quarters earlier in your new college. College is not the end of the world though, even a college that overlap poorly with a major is more than survivable. \n\n# I'm waitlisted. What should I do next?\n\n[From UC San Diego Admission Website](https://admissions.ucsd.edu/first-year/application-timeline.html)\n\n> Select applicants will be invited to opt in to our waitlist through their Applicant Portal.\n\n> First-Year applicants must opt in by 11:59 pm PST on April 15.\n\n> Being on the waitlist does not guarantee an offer of admission. We strongly urge students to accept another university's admission offer before the appropriate deadline to ensure they have secured a spot at an institution.\n\n> By June 30, final decisions will be released to applicants who opt in to the waitlist.

If anyone wants to comment on this choice, pls do. My parents are still a bit dicy since they have a huge personal belief that UIUC is the premium cs and tech school after the big 4 (mit Stanford uc berk and cmu). I told them that UIUC's school of information is not that good as UIUC cs and engineering in terms of placement and strength of the degree. Another ug student from UIUC told me that I only need to do calc 2 level study for data sciences. Inner me was disappointed af since I have already done linear algebra and my maths teacher (a gem) is conducting discrete math classes for me since March beginning\n\n2. Do maths cs majors get good internships? I have done Harvard cs 50 courses, both intro and web dev one. I took private classes before for coding in order to be good at competitive programming. I feel more than rigorous coding, I became more interested in the maths part and cracking puzzles through algorithms. Before coming to UCSD, what should I do to get a leg up. (I have already relaxed during my final exams \ud83d\ude2d, now I really wanna return to old me so pls tell the courses to do. I can't rest) \n\n3. I have good graphics skill wrt to ui designing in Adobe softwares. How do I use this to my advantage? I can go ahead with front end dev I guess for getting side jobs or internships during my freshman year. So, my questions basically revolves around the fact that do frosh students get internships via UCSD or not. \n\n4. Dating scene: how tough is it to approach girls? \n\n5.

CS was my first choice, but I'm very much content with where I'm at right now.\n\n>What are your thoughts on this major? Do you think it's worth going here if I stay in this major but only want to work in tech?\n\nMath-CS is a pretty good major. The main thing I like about Math-CS is that it's *flexible* \\-- if I wanted to, I could have graduated a year earlier. Or, I could do off-season tech internships/co-ops. Or, I could take classes that were interesting.\n\nYes. I know many Math-CS majors who have interned at pretty big companies or otherwise are working full-time as software engineers. I've interned last Fall and will be interning during the summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>One thing I'm worried about is how people might view this major as an interdisciplinary major that requires a few extra years of grad school, plus the extra time spent juggling between computer science and especially math courses which are not my strong suit.\n\nThis is a valid concern, and one that I've had when I was deciding between where I wanted to go.\n\nWith regards to the courses, yes, you will need to take a number of math classes. If you absolutely despise math, you absolutely *do not* want to be a Math-CS major. It's simply not worth your time or the suffering. However, if you're *open* to taking math classes, I can tell you that most of the upper-level math classes I've taken (proof-based classes) were pretty interesting and eye-opening, albeit challenging. That being said, a lot of classes you will need to take will be pretty challenging, so keep that in mind.\n\nWith regards to grad school, I never really saw it like that. The people I know who are going to grad school are people who generally either want to specialize in a certain field, want to take more CS courses, or are simply doing it because they don't have a job at the end of the day (and this applies to everyone, not just Math-CS students). From talking to Math-CS graduates, you can very well succeed in industry with just a B.S. in Math-CS.\n\n>However, the other options I have are not very good in my opinion and alongside its popularity I always thought about going to this school for reasons such as being close to home and the very nice beaches (Even though Warren is probably the farthest from those beaches).\n\nKeep in mind that we have pretty decent transportation through MTS and NCTD, two of San Diego's transportation systems. UCSD students get \"free\" passes that allow for unlimited rides on buses and light rail on both transit services (I say \"free\" in quotes because you're really paying for it through your student fees).\n\nAmong other options, you can take MTS Bus 30 to downtown La Jolla, Pacific Beach, and so on. Or, you can take NCTD Bus 101 to Del Mar, Solana Beach, Carlsbad, and so on. These buses, and many more, all stop by our campus (Gilman Transit Center, or Gilman & Myers).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you went back in time, would you change your decision to enroll at UCSD for Mathematics-Computer Science?\n\nNo. I've made a lot of friends here and I feel like I've learned a lot.\n\n\\------\n\nI do want to say this, though.\n\n> The other schools I got accepted to were UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC Merced for Computer Science. \n\nIf you 100% want to do pure CS, you should look into the other schools. The other UCs are all good UCs. \n\n> I was accepted to UC Irvine as Undeclared. \n\nI'm not sure if things have changed, but I'm pretty sure the only difficult part about switching into CS at UCI is that it's hard to get into some of the classes that you need in order to switch (since you do not have priority registration). You might want to see if r/UCI has any additional information on this, though. \n\n\\------\n\nI probably didn't answer all of your questions too in-depth, so feel free to respond back if you have any questions.

I actually went to UCD my first year prior to covid and transferred here in 2022 so I can give a bit of background of my experience.

Though after two quarters I felt like once I explored everything I kinda felt stagnant. Your pros and cons for UCD are very valid lol. The best thing I loved about Davis is how great the DCs were and the fresh food (Cuarto dining bias). From what I remembered it was unlimited swipes and the ARC is great. I think I was in the best physical shape and the most active and healthy. \n\nI'm not entirely sure how important family is for you, but for me, being far away from family is a really big challenge emotionally and mentally. I had a family death occur fall my first year and that weighted on me a lot. Personally decided to drop out during covid and take a gap year back home. I have completely enjoyed and grateful for my experience at UCD for being so far from home, but it also made me appreciate my loved ones a lot more.\n\nMy favorite aspect of UCSD is definitely how resourceful the campus is. Majority of lectures are automatically podcasted and makes attending optional (But also might not be the best learning experience, in person lectures definitely help me learn the best). I think the professors (at least in the psych department) have a really good balance of great teaching and research. Being at a very research driven school your knowledge is very in tune of the most up to date science. Some of my upper div classes don't require textbooks because they are too outdated and my professor's research is being taught. I haven't had a bad professor experience here but I can think of a few professors at UCD that I did not enjoy. \n\nThe location is the prime spot in San Diego. The ocean is less than a mile away and you will have a free trolley pass to go to anywhere in SD. Everywhere on campus is walkable and each college give a cool environmental feel. La Jolla is quite expensive location too - so housing in general will be a constant challenge. \n\nI can't speak on pre-med accommodations but I heard nothing but great things about UCSD Health. \n\nWould I have attended UCSD instead of UCD my first year? No, I think I would still wanted to get out of the SD bubble and made me appreciate a lot of things I took for granted at home.

So the thing with being a k-12 teacher in the US is that in basically every state, you need two qualifications: a bachelor's degree and a teaching credential. Teaching credentials are state-by-state, but with some reciprocity. A bachelor's degree is obviously universal. The thing is that it doesn't really matter what degree you have - generally you'll need a STEM degree to teach STEM in a High School, but otherwise, they don't really care. \n\nSo, the upside of going for EDS is that you get the education theory. However, the education theory you'll get studying EDS is really not that helpful - you're gonna get that getting your credential anyway, as well via CEUs (continuing education units) that you'll need to be getting every year. Because you don't get a credential after a 4-year EDS degree, you still have to go through the post-bacc process, which costs money and time. I think some of your practicum counts towards credential hours (not sure about that, I could be wrong - either way, you can't graduate and go straight to a teaching job).\n\nThe big risk is if you realize teaching isn't for you. Please understand that I don't want to poo-poo your dream - I share it. I really loved working in schools when I did, and quite a few of the teachers I worked with encouraged me to go into the field myself. The thing that scared me off it is that almost universally, every teacher over about 45 I met was burnt out and either felt numb or hated their job. This was at multiple districts, one in a very poor neighborhood (ARUSD) and one in a wealthy neighborhood (SJUSD, and a wealthy area at that). If you have a degree in EDS and decide you want out, your options are basically: more school, sales for a company that sells to schools, or some kind of adult training/teaching role (which tend to be hard to get since a lot of people flee teaching, sadly.) \n\nOn the other hand, if you get a degree in something else that you like and are interested in but that also has some value on the job market, you've got more options if you decide teaching isn't for you. A good middle ground is a double major, which shouldn't be too bad since EDS is not that bad compared to a lot of majors. EDS has a [program](https://eds.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/major.html#Senior-Educational-Fieldwork-Ca) where you can double major and then skip some of the subject matter tests you'd need to take to teach specific subjects. \n\nNo matter what you choose, I wish you good luck!

If you don't get in, you can fit in the CSE classes you missed where it makes sense in your schedule, if you do you can do those EE classes you skipped whenever. \n\nI would say start going through the major requirements, screening requirements, and the sample 4 years plans and make a first year plan optimizing for the screening courses over all else. Then make the last 3 years for both cases: you get into EE or you stay CE.

I know some follow the 3 year plan that are sometimes given in majors. Most 3 year plans designed by departments do include summer classes. But sometimes you can graduate without summer classes. For example, I'm possibly going to be able to receive all my units by my 3rd year due to a combination of AP and city college courses I took in high school, so this could also be a reason you might graduate early. Currently for my general eds, I'm taking 3 classes since they are harder STEM classes and I want more time to really focus on them. But the rest of my time at UCSD I'll be taking 4 classes per quarter, if not 5 if its an easier general ed.\n\nThe number of classes you take per quarter are completely up to you, however for financial aid, you need to take at least 12 units to be considered a full-time student and receive your full reward.
