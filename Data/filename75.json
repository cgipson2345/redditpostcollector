    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "#Introduction\n\nMany transfer students struggle with identifying a good topic for their essay.  Conventional wisdom says to just answer the prompt, but the transfer prompts can be very tricky.  They usually ask about your reasons for wanting to transfer and many students end up being overly negative in their response.  Other advice says to start by brainstorming a list of potential topics related to your educational path and future goals, and chances are you have already started a mental list of ideas.  You might think you only have a few choices for topics, based on your problems with your current school or things you love about the schools you\u2019re considering.  You may have even started writing a rough draft or two.  I advise, however, that you put down your list of topics and back away from it. Forget that exists for a moment.  Seriously, thinking about this initial list tethers you to certain ideas that might not actually be your best options.  Take a minute to let go of those.\n\nNow you can begin brainstorming with a clean slate.\n\nMy strategy is this: start with thinking about what you want to show in your entire application, not just one essay. Every single thing in your transfer app has one purpose - to tell more about you and show how you will fit the new school.  Filling out the application by rote and tackling each section independently is short-sighted and will leave so much potential untapped in your application.  \n\n#About Transfer Application Review\n\nAn admissions officer\u2019s goal is to understand you fully, in the context of your background and the rest of the applicant pool. Throughout this process, their focus will be primarily academic.  They will begin by assessing your academic abilities and potential.  This is chiefly done through analysis of your college transcript - your course selection and performance, especially in core/major classes.  These include English/writing, math, hard science (e.g. biology, chemistry, or physics rather than say, psychology) and some social sciences as well as any courses you\u2019ve taken in your major. \n\nNext, they will evaluate how you will fit into the student body and campus community. This relies heavily on your letters of recommendation, activities, and essays.  They want to see that you will contribute to the vibrant intellectual scene they\u2019ve worked so hard to build through freshman admissions.  The last thing they want to do is bring in \u201cproblem students\u201d who will struggle academically or drag down the culture and social dynamics on campus.  \n\nThey will want to see that your interests have focused and that you\u2019re pursuing them with more depth than you were in high school.  This is especially true of your intellectual and academic interests.  \n\nAll of this can be somewhat broad and diverse and touch on several institutional goals. But they will dig deep to find out what each applicant is like, what your core values and motivations are, what kind of student you will be, how you will contribute, etc.  Two key questions many reviewers seek to answer are 1) what will this student bring to campus? And 2) what will they take away?  They want to clearly visualize the ways you will add to the campus community and the ways you will benefit and grow from the experience.\n\n#Introspection\n\nYour goal with your essay is to powerfully tell your story in a manner that will fit these criteria.  The entirety of your application (again, not just one essay) aims to showcase your abilities, qualifications, and uncommon attributes as a person in a positive way.  You need to show passion for your chosen academic path and present a compelling case for how both you and the new school will benefit from your enrollment there.  Before you begin outlining or writing your application, you must determine what is unique about you that will stand out to an admissions panel.  All students are truly unique.  Not one other student has the same combination of life experiences, personality, passions, or goals as you do; your job in your application is to frame your unique personal attributes in a positive and compelling way.  How will you fit on campus? What personal qualities, strengths, core values, talents, or different perspectives do you bring to the table? What deeper motivations/beliefs or formative experiences can you use to illustrate all of this?  How will you impact the classrooms, labs, campus organizations, etc?\n\nYou might not immediately know what you want to share about yourself.  It\u2019s not a simple task to decide how to summarize your whole life or academic arc and being in a powerful and eloquent way on your application.  Therefore, it is always helpful to start with some soul-searching and self-examination.  This takes additional time and effort rather than jumping straight into your first draft.  But it is also a valuable method to start writing a winning application that stands out from the stack.  By the time you're finished, you should have several different topics or stories around which to build your application.\n\nYou cannot gracefully fit all you want to communicate into one essay.  Instead make sure your vision is clearly conveyed somewhere in your application. Each component only needs to carry a small part of your message.  Your essay is the most dynamic component, but every section is vital to the overall effectiveness of your application.\n\nNote: once you begin writing, remember that you shouldn't address any of this directly. Be indirect and subtle, and use examples/stories and details to make your main points. Don't chisel them into stone tablets and bash the reviewer in the face or yell \"Look how smart I am!\" That also means you shouldn\u2019t say \"I'm a great team player and I can't wait to contribute at X College!\" Instead, show an example of a time you worked on a team effectively and let the reviewer form their own conclusions.  I cover this in greater detail in my essay guide, but it\u2019s worth noting here as it\u2019s part of the process of picking a topic. \n\n#Introspection Questions\n\nThe list of questions below is excerpted from my full transfer student introspection worksheet.  These questions will help you examine yourself and discover potential topics, stories, or characteristics to highlight in your essays and application.  It will also help you decide how to present yourself.  As you consider each of these questions, focus on your core values, aspirations, foundational beliefs, personality traits, motivations, passions, and personal strengths.\n\nThere are a lot of questions, and I DO NOT expect you to answer them all.  You should only respond to the ones that speak to you, spark a memory, or inspire some facet of yourself that you want to share.  I recommend that you read through all of the questions first, then go back and write down answers to a couple from each section.  Don\u2019t write long answers to these questions; simply jot down your thoughts.  The goal is not to actually write your essays now, but to brainstorm your thoughts in an unfiltered and natural manner, to start ideas flowing.  I suggest that you spend about an hour on this, then stop and re-evaluate.  If you finish and feel that you don't have enough material, review the questions again and brainstorm some more.  \n\n#Superlatives \n\nIntrospection is challenging, but it's often easier to start thinking in terms of superlatives.  Think about some of the superlatives in your life \u2013 what are the most meaningful things about you?  \n\n- What moments were most memorable, formative, enlightening, enjoyable, or valuable?  What are your favorite memories? Why?  What are your favorites since high school?\n\n- What physical possessions, experiences, dreams, or lessons could make your superlatives list? \n\n- Think about what things, people, or circumstances in your life are really unique, fascinating, different, or outlandish. Are there any that really have a lot of \"cultural flavor\" (whatever your culture is)?\n\n- What items or stories from this list could make up your \u201ctwo truths\u201d in \u201cTwo Truths and a Lie?\u201d \"Two Truths and a Lie\" is a game where each person lists two truths about themselves and one lie.  The other players have to try to identify the lie.  Which two truths would be most interesting to someone who just met you? \n\n- List three of the strongest or most controversial opinions you have.  What have you done to stand up for these beliefs or opinions?\n\n- What opinions, beliefs, or ideas do you have that have changed since you finished high school?  How and why did they change?  What did you learn from that experience?\n\n- List two ways you stand out from your peers.  Assume 50 students are randomly selected from your college.  List one or two subjects, disciplines, or topics for which you would likely have the most expertise in that group. \n\n- What do you value the most in your life?  What would be the hardest to lose or give up?  What things are you most grateful for?  Why are these things important to you? \n\n- What are you most passionate about?  Why?  What do you wish you were more passionate about? \n\n- Do a quick Google search for \u201ccore values\u201d.  Pick a list and identify at least five that you connect with the most.  Sometimes it helps to start with ten or more and then narrow this list down.  Now that you have a list, think about why each of those is important to you.  What stories or examples from your life illustrate your dedication to these core values?  \n\n#Your College Experience So Far \n\nTake some time to think about what college has been like so far.  Many transfer applications will ask about what challenges you\u2019ve faced or what has led you to desire transferring, so it can be helpful to reflect on this.  \n\n- What have you appreciated most about college so far?  What have you gained from it?\n\n- What has surprised you the most since high school?  These can be positive or negative.  Try to think of some things that are academic in nature and some that aren\u2019t.\n\n- What do you wish you had done differently with your educational journey to this point?  How have you grown or learned from the challenges or setbacks you\u2019ve faced?\n\n- What are the top three strengths of the college or program you\u2019re currently enrolled in?  What do you like or value the most about it?\nWhat are its weaknesses?  What is missing that your potential transfer destinations might fulfill?  Do you feel these shortcomings are endemic, or specific to your particular situation (i.e. do you think everyone has these issues or just you)?\n\n- Regarding your academic trajectory, do you feel a greater sense of purpose, increased specificity / clarity, or more focused scope than you had when you started college?  What does this new arc look like?  Where do you want it to lead?  What experiences brought that clearer view or pointed you in that particular direction?  If you don\u2019t feel like your interests/pursuits have narrowed, spend some time thinking about what that might look like.  If you had to pick a career or graduate program today, what would you choose?  How will transferring help you solidify and progress down that path?\n\n- Attempts to transfer can be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons - course/credit equivalency issues, financial aid, failure to gain admission, etc.  If your transfer doesn\u2019t work out, what is plan B?     \n\n#A Brighter Future - Your New College and Beyond \n\nNow turn your focus on your new college specifically.  Transferring colleges is among the biggest decisions and investments you will ever make so analyzing your process and rationale can be very illuminating into how you think, prioritize, and plan.  Thinking beyond college can also help you see the big picture of your life and what you want from it.  These questions can be especially helpful for the \u201cwhy do you want to transfer here\u201d essay prompts.\n\n- List three things you like about your current major.  Rank them if you can.  Why are these appealing to you?\n\n- List three to five things you hope to get out of transferring colleges.  Keep your focus beyond prestige, career, and salary.\n\n- List five things you want to change or improve about yourself by the time you finish college.  How will you pursue this?\n\n- List five colleges you are interested in transferring to.  What are the most important factors to you in deciding on a college, e.g. cost, location, academics, rankings, specifics of the program you want, etc?\n\n- How do you define success?  What things would make you feel successful one, five, or ten years from now? \n\n- If you were given a million dollars to drop out of college entirely, would you do it? What would you do instead of college? \n\n- List five potential careers or jobs that you might want to have someday.  If you want to take this a step further, look up some job postings on Indeed.com or another job board to see more specifics.\n\n- List five goals or dreams you have for your future.  These could be academic, personal, or professional. \n\n#Connecting Introspection To The Common Application\n\nThe Common Application for Transfer Students has just one essay prompt:\n\n>\u201cProvide a statement discussing your educational path, such as how continuing your education at a new institution will help you achieve your future goals, in 1,250 \u2013 3,250 characters (about 250 \u2013 650 words).\u201d \n\nNote that some colleges that use the Common App may not require this essay or they may require other additional essays.  For example, the University of Washington transfer application includes twelve prompts and allows students to respond to as many of them as they like.  Visit the transfer admissions website of each school you\u2019re considering and gather all of the prompts into a single document.  The next step in introspection is to formulate a few possible answers to these in just a brief sentence or two (e.g. 280 characters or less).  This will help you consider some of the various approaches you might use and how you might organize your thoughts and present a cohesive view of who you are.  \n\nHopefully you will notice that many of the questions you've already answered or considered in this worksheet can be used as building blocks.  Which prospective responses have the most potential to showcase the best you have to offer to a college?  Which highlight your passions, your motivations, your core values, and your uniqueness?  Try not to think about which response or topic will be the easiest to write - in fact, that might be your worst choice.  Reread the introduction to this worksheet and review your application goals as this might help you focus.  If there are multiple responses you feel have promise and fit your arc, go deeper into outlining each essay to see which is the most compelling and how to match these up to the various short questions or other essay requirements of your specific colleges.\n\nIf you're interested in a professional review of your essays or application, PM me or find me at www.bettercollegeapps.com.

I am looking to attend a university with a proficient and rigorous cognitive science program. Cornell, Rice, and Brown are among the top that I am applying to. There is one issue, however. In 2020, I attended Texas Tech University and ended up Dropping out. I basically failed a majority of my classes, I was suffering a terrible mental health crisis and couldn't even get out of bed. So, after a few months, I decided to give school a chance again. For context, I did very well in High School. I was the captain of my dance team, Editor of the yearbook, and took several AP courses. I also had a 3.6 and was in the top 20% of my class. I am aware that the odds are against me, however, I've heard a multitude of stories about students who didn't do well at their primary institution, yet managed to attend top universities.\n\nWhen I transfer, I will have completed four semesters of Community College.

I'm guessing that by City College, you mean CCNY, which is a CUNY. CUNY is fine, I went to a SUNY community college myself and loved it. Looking at their CS major requirements, it looks broadly similar to other Computer Science major requirements. You'll learn mostly the same shit. Actually has more major requirements than my school, very few electives. I assume you applied to more than just CCNY and Dartmouth, and CCNY is just where you got in. What's wrong with going to CCNY? It's all the same shit.\n\nThat being said, if for some reason you want to treat CCNY as if it were a community college and break up your college experience rather than just experiencing four years in one place and having a better chance to form deeper friendships, [SUNY's Computer Science transfer path](https://www.suny.edu/attend/get-started/transfer-students/suny-transfer-paths/pdf/transferSUNY_Computer_Science.pdf) is pretty on the money as far as what colleges want you to have taken in your first two years. Make sure to do Freshman Composition, Calculus I, Introduction to Computing, Chemistry I, Discrete Math, Calculus II, University Physics I (calculus-based), Data Structures, Calculus III, and University Physics II within your first two years in order to satisfy what universities will want from a transfer student. I'm not sure what exactly they want from people who transfer after just one year because I transferred after two, but these are the courses they look for from people transferring after two years, all of which are part of your degree at CCNY\n\nAs far as SAT/ACT, I personally only applied to places that don't require them from transfer students, I doubt they're super helpful, but I don't know. As far as ECs, personally i just joined the couple clubs that interested me. I'd say do whatever interests you and just go for it. I wouldn't personally try to mold myself into what they want, just actively be yourself, and find ways to document that so you can show that you are a cool person. I got a really nice letter of recommendation from the head of CS at my community college because I was very active in like, helping people, leading clubs, being social, etc. I don't think it's worth hiring someone to help you, and idk how high school advisors are, but they probably don't know much about transfer stuff anyway, just look online and use common sense. It's all a slot machine anyway.\n\nPersonally I'd say just stick with CCNY, why not? It looks like a fine school, you can do anything anywhere. Regardless of what you do, good luck\n\nEdit: Also, if you do decide to transfer, apply across the whole spectrum of places you'd rather go to than CCNY, not just Dartmouth and Columbia. You're not going to get into Dartmouth or Columbia. If you're lucky maybe you'll get into University of Rochester. You can likely get into RIT or Binghamton or Buffalo. Maybe Stony Brook.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "even writing this post makes me absolutely sick lol any help is greatly appreciated.\n\nPretty new to reddit so my apologies if this isn't formatted correctly. I (21f) go to an in-state school and am a bio major, initially hoping to pursue a career in child psychiatry. I was on the dean's list both semesters my freshman year and held competitive mental health internships the following summer. I excelled in my courses, but in fall 2021 I had a severe breakthrough covid case that I was hospitalized for, as well as later complications from being immunocomp (lower kidney infection, strep throat, lol it was awful.) I was forced to do a medical withdraw that November due to this and received tuition reimbursement, both of which were very involved processes.\n\nI was devastated to be set back midway through so much hard work but resumed my courses the spring semester. This is where things get worse...\n\nI experienced a traumatic sexual assault midway during this semester. I ended up withdrawing from every class except a child psych class (I had a great relationship with my professor and had her both semesters freshman year, so this was the only prof I shared the assault with at first.) I intended on not returning to this school the upcoming semester and planned on taking a semester off and transferring after I finished my summer mental health job. My Dean of Students representative was supportive and encouraged me to stay at my school and contact my past professors. So I returned!\n\nDuring *this* semester (Fall 2022), I was disowned by my family for being gay (I am a brown first-gen American with a religious family, my dad died when I was in highschool, my extended family was generous enough to pay until they knew) and lost all financial help from them. I still have no idea how they found out. My school has a partnership with UPS that night shift workers at this job can have tuition paid for, and I chose this route over loans. Big mistake.\n\nThe schedule was 11pm-5am nightly, and come November it was 11:20pm -8am, M-F. I was taking 12 credit hours, but I still could not keep up in my 300 level courses. I failed every class.\n\nI feel like a complete failure. I have unpaid tuition left from last semester. I feel like my dream is completely unattainable and like my life is over now. It all feels like excuses and that if I worked harder or tried more I would've been able to not let my assault ruin my academics or be able to work third shift and do pre-med.\n\nAnyways.

I started in Fall of 2019, have completed 95 credits of my course, and have 26 remaining.\n\nI also work full-time in Cybersecurity (45hrs/week), work 100% from home and live 25 miles from my campus (important later).\n\nI was hired by my current employer, in no small part because I told them I was starting school for a Cybersecurity degree. They're even covering part of the tuition.\n\n# Recent Schedule\n\nThe arrangement has been working out for the first few years. I have either attended classes Asynchronous online, Remote Synchronous Online, or in-person evening labs. I am only taking 2 classes (6-8cr) per semester, which is fine for me as I was never in any rush to graduate.\n\nI was even able to arrange a schedule with my employer, where I take a half-lunch period and clock out 30min early to make it to class. \n\n# My scheduling problems\n\nFor the past semester or two, it has been getting more and more difficult to find online and evening classes. I noticed that it was easier in earlier semesters, likely because I was doing a lot of Gen Ed requirements that were taught by adjuncts in the evening.\n\nNow that I'm getting into the meat of my Major courses, they are all Full-time faculty working 9a-5p schedules. Herein lies the problem.\n\nThe ONLY class schedules I can make are (in order of preference):\n\n1. Online Asynchronous\n2. Remote Synchronous, Evening lecture\n3. In-Person, Evening Class\n\n# Dilemma\n\nI have maybe 2 class options for the Fall. I can squeeze it this time... (see my comment for Fall course options).\n\nBigger problem is what I do later on? That only takes care of this Fall. I still have 20 more credits that are only offered during the day.\n\nAlready emailed my Department chair, as well as the school provost. Basically imporing them to add more evening or online classes for commuter students. They helped me enroll for some classes that required Prereqs in the past, but this time they basically told me to deal with it.\n\n# Transfer?\n\nThis is seeming more and more like my only option. I highly doubt my job would allow me to take many hours off of work each week, for the next 2 years. and I can't afford to take a sabbatical, I have a mortgage to pay!\n\nSo... this was a long-winded post to basically ask if there is a website that allows me to see what credits I could transfer.

Then quarantine came around and not only was I working a shitty job exploring a degree I no longer had confidence in, but now I was completely cut off from all social activity. Everyone was sent home except for a very few that were thrown into the dorms. I saw a total of about 7 different people during that semester. My grades plummeted along with my mental well being. I was sleeping 10-13 hours a day, working 6-7, and couldnt\u00a0bring myself to do any studying when I got off work. I explored different degrees the next semester but ended up being placed on academic suspension. I chose not to go back and waste any more money.

Went to a big state school for 2 years and had a 1.5 when I dropped out in December of 2014. Unlike your situation, I was just an immature dumbass. Ended up joining the Marines in 2015 and it really helped me turn my life around. Went to Community College full time during my last two years in the Marines and after starting from complete scratch credit wise, I finished my AA in December of 2022 with a 4.0, 5 days before leaving the military. In my spare time I built some solid EC\u2019s. Been a volunteer firefighter for two years, was an officer in PTK, worked a second job as a paid Econ (my major) tutor, and did some accounting work for a military affiliated non profit organization. Was encouraged to apply by AO\u2019s at Princeton, Penn, and UNC. Also sent apps to Harvard, Cornell, Vandy, Duke, and UVA for this cycle.\n\nMoral of the story: Everyone has a different path. You are by no means the only person to ever fail their first attempt at college, and it is 100% feasible for you to attempt to go to a T20 or T10 school. How you go about doing that, is totally up to you. \n\nMy recommendations for you would be to start with research. Pick out some target schools (5-10) that you want to apply to and look at the general stats, prerequisites for transfer, etc. Once you do that write all the info out on one sheet to consolidate everything. The research phase is constant. Surf these forums from time to time and try to connect with people who have already transferred to your target schools. I\u2019ve gotten some good advice doing that the last couple years. \n\nNext, look at cheap, local schools. I personally attended a CC but your situation may call for something different. Plan your class schedule according to your target schools general requirements and essentially start from scratch with your credits. It sucks to start over but it\u2019s gonna be necessary if T10\u2019s are your goal. \n\nThirdly, keep your head up for some solid EC\u2019s. Quality over quantity. You don\u2019t need to hop in them the minute you start back to school, but you will need to begin participating sooner rather than later. \n\nLastly, and this is by far the most important part, prioritize your mental health. I did a horrible job of that during the last two years and even though I have a decent shots at some killer schools, I developed sleep apnea and anxiety during that time, both of which I now have to take medicine for. Mental health is a tricky one as everyone is different so I don\u2019t want to give to much advice as to how you as an individual should combat this, but just be cognizant of it.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll learn more as time progresses and you experience more but that\u2019s the general gist of it now. Research, GPA, EC\u2019s, MH should be consistent until you submit your last transfer app. Best of luck and hope I see you post a success story in a couple years \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb", "score": 5, "author": "Significant_Job_4099"}]},

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "Hey Folks!\n\nA quick rundown on me: I'm a mid-30's returning student. When I first attended college in the early 2000's, I was incredibly lazy and irresponsible. I enrolled in classes, then never attended them or dropped them. This resulted in ***numerous F's*** being added to my transcript. In 2007 I was put on academic suspension and left college with a cumulative 0.91 GPA. Yes... 0.91. I took one additional semester in 2012, did *ok* and moved that up a little bit to 1.21, but still quite a terrible performance. \n\nJump to 2021. I had a found field I was/am passionate about and even worked in; that being computer science. I understood the basics, but genuinely wanted to understand more about it. I wanted to go back to school but was flooded with feelings of doubt due to the overwhelming failure of my previous attempts. I was genuinely scared I would not be able to dig myself out of the hole I created enough to graduate with an AS; let alone transfer to a 4-year program. \n\nI decided to bite the bullet and commit to the future I wanted. Since then, I have spent the last three semesters (this is my fourth and last) at a local community college, where I have completed 38 credits with a 3.89 GPA. My current cumulative GPA is also 2.67. Still not where I would like it to be, but a major improvement from where it was.\n\nHere is where my issue comes in. I'm in the process of sending out transfer applications to universities. Most of them are public universities with competitive programs to get into (think UW Madison, Colorado --Boulder, etc.). My goal is to get into their College of Science and Engineering, however, because of my own doing my technical GPA is still very low. Too many failed attempts at too many courses when I was younger. I've had schools lean into the idea that I'd be fine getting a BA in Computer Science, but that's not what I want. Nor is it what I've worked so hard for. Especially since some of the universities I've applied to have been at transfer fairs for my school and stated the courses I've taken are on par in terms of difficulty and curriculum covered with theirs.\n\nWhat can I do (if anything) besides plead my case on my transfer applications, that I'm a different student than the one my transcript makes me out to be? Is there something can do to help my chances of getting into CSE? Or should I just settle with going into CLA because the of academic mistakes I made 15+ years ago? Also, am I crazy to think courses from so long ago shouldn't play negatively into my application process?\n\nPlease note, I do not think there is anything wrong with liberal arts colleges, I just prefer the remainder of my schooling be focused on my field of interest, and not include additional work outside of it.\n\n**TL:DR** I was terrible college student in the early 2000's.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "Hi everyone, using a throwaway for this as I don't want this on my main account.\n\nI am currently a Community College student in CT, I am majoring in Computer Science. I plan on transferring to a state university. However, I have a bad GPA, I am able to get a good letter of recommendation, from my English professor as I had him twice and got an A both times and he knows me best in terms of personal and academic strengths. I would get one from a CS professor but I never got close with any of them as it was a \"come in at 3, listen to the lecture, leave at 5\" type deal, and I never needed any help so they don't really know me. By bad GPA I mean, ~~2.0(just my estimate due to the winter semester)~~  I have a 2.1. In my first semester, I essentially got A's and one B. My second semester, slightly worse, Mostly A's, 1 B+, 1 C+, and one withdraw. I then took three summer classes(an Absolutely terrible idea, this is where my downfall started). I got a B, and two F's. Then comes around fall semester. Initially took 19 credits worth of classes. I withdrew from two as the load was too much, but then I failed two classes but I got an A in the other two. I then took a winter semester to try to get it back up, I got 2 Ds and 1 F.\n\nHonestly, I'm not entirely sure why I'm on this path. I feel like shit because of it, and feel that my future is bleak as I think it will be difficult to transfer and graduate. For further context, the classes where I did terrible were all Gen-eds, but the classes I got A's in were Statistics, Graphic Design, Calculus 1, Java Programming, C++, Visual Basic, and Composition as far as I remember. So, the classes I did worse in were humanities related, accelerated ones at that(7-weeks for the summer, 3 weeks for the winter). The class I got a B in for the summer semester was Macroeconomics for reference.\n\nI never failed any Major-related classes, I passed them. The ones I failed were gen-eds. So, as this is my final semester at community college, well I hope it is, as I can't do community college anymore, the classes are online for the most part. I want to transfer to a state university, I know I can handle the work, especially if its related to my major. Another reason I know I can handle it is because the ones I took in-person, I had essentially stellar grades, while the ones I did terrible in were fully online, no interaction between peers and professors. The state university has all classes in-person, which is my preferred form of study.\n\nI think another component to why I did bad is because, well, I have always been passionate about tech, programming, robotics, you name it. I am able to focus on those with ease, while with gen-eds, I can't, especially because they are online. No drive for the gen-eds, I just, forget about them essentially, until its too late. I genuinely do believe I have undiagnosed ADD/ADHD, which I do plan on getting checked. I tried other things to see if it helps with my inattentiveness to gen-eds. I tried working out and eating healthier, it helped, but only slightly. I don't party either.\n\nSo, In the end, I want to transfer for the fall semester. I believe that my good grades in Major related courses will help make up for the poor grades in gen-eds. Especially with the Spring semester now, I am aiming for A's to bring up the GPA. However, I'm not sure what to write for my personal statement. I am thinking about writing about my passion for Computer Science, and the struggles I faced the past few semesters and what I tried. How I can succeed in the proper environment(in-person). Will admissions be more lenient with the courses I took in the summer and winter? What are your thoughts?

You'll have to apply for the 4yr university in the fall before you graduate from your community college. Then, usually near the beginning of your final semester at community College, you'll have to apply for graduation. After you get your final grades from your community college, you will have to submit your final transcripts from your community College to the university. Then, you will need to make an appointment with the university conselor to create your schedule. This is really important to make sure you aren't skipping over any class requirements that  are specific to that university. If you transfer, you are probably safe on that, but its better to know than to find out when you are trying to graduate. Around the point you'll probably want to apply for yout FAFSA too, but that's a deadline you should discuss with the university's financial aid office. \n\nI'm a transfer student who has also taken forever to get through school because of personal/pandemic related reasons. It's obviously saves a ton of money transferring and getting your general requirements done. It also means you can focus on your major core classes once you transfer.

Usually they have overall nicer facilities and more opportunities for students to engage with campus, more student aid resources, and work opportunities outside of class. \n\nPersonally, the social transition was difficult for me because I had to adjust to my new school while most other people in my classes had already been there for at least 2 years.

That's just something you'll have yo figure out based on your situation and your tuition.\n\n I love school and I really love my major. I think everyone should pursue some kind of education as an adult. Just make sure that your degree/potential career opportunities are worth the commitment and the debt you might leave with.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "In April of 2021, the [NCAA](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/34967085/college-football-new-transfer-portal-windows-explained) revised its\u00a0 transfer portal restrictions, allowing athletes immediate eligibility upon transferring to a new school\u00a0 Since then, there has been a major influx in transfers, as athletes now have tons of leverage and no longer have to sit out a year as was previously required.\u00a0\n\nIn a recently revised rule, Division 1 athletes who enter the portal in a 60 day span will be able to maintain immediate eligibility, if, and only if, it is their first time transferring. However, the 60 day block is split up into two periods. The first\u00a0 begins after the day championship selections are made for respective fall sports. For Division One Women\u2019s Soccer those days are November 8th to December 22nd, and May 1st to May 15th. However the immediate eligibility only applies to Division one athletes. Division II and III portals will be open on a more regular basis, throughout the year, with their launch date also being [November 8th](https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/ncaa-board-approves-transfer-portal-windows-modernizes-infractions-process/amp/).\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been less than a week. Yet, the number of athletes who have hit the portal is wild. After just one day, the number was reported to be 162. A few days later the numbers continued to increase and as of November 11th, it stood at 681. What is causing this?\n\n## A Few Reasons for Mass Transfers\n\nFor one, it is hard to pass up the idea of immediate eligibility, plus the possibility of an extra year of eligibility due to Covid-19. Athletes also can become fed up or unhappy with their playing time and their interpersonal relationships can sometimes affect their portal justification. Communication with couches or teammates is really something that can skew a college soccer player to hit the portal. Even if you liked playing at your school, a sudden departure of a head coach or assistant coach can change everything in a flash. Also, it is worth noting that players who do not seem themselves playing beyond college may want a more rigorous institution, thus they head for the portal.\n\n## Transfer With Caution\n\nThough, it is worth noting that with all of the players that have recently hit the portal, it is quite possible that some don\u2019t unfortunately find a future home.\u00a0 Teams can only take so many players and the NLI initial signing day\u00a0has already passed. Just over [50 percent ](https://www.stack.com/a/tracking-trends-in-the-ncaa-transfer-portal/)of last year\u2019s players in the transfer portal found a new destination, while more than 40 percent were still looking. 1The transfer portal can be intense, rigorous, stressful, and within the past year, players learned that. Whether your heart is invested in a program or not, just remember that all decisions come with caution.\n\n**TLDR: Essentially 600+ Female College Soccer players have entered the transfer portal in the month of November across all NCAA divisions. My question is why do you think this is happening? Is it the schools, the changes in conference alignment, the coaches, NIL? What factors do you think are causing such an influx of transfers?**", "title": "College Soccer Transfer News: Why Are So Many Athletes Transferring?

I know this is very normal and common especially considering how early it is,  but it's very hard to look at other people having fun while you sit in your dorm alone. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't even think about transferring until next year. However, my school offers little to no extra curricular clubs and the ones that do exist are either going to be cancelled soon or are incredibly small. I've tried to be very outgoing and make friends through my classes, however because of the midsize of my school it is incredibly cliquey. I did a lot of performing arts in high school so I auditioned for several groups, but unfortunately I got rejected from them all. I obviously understand that I can't get into everything, but it's upsetting since I've been told by many people you can only get in if you know someone in advance. As much as I wanna stick it out and try, I don't see how I'd be able to make friends. I've been thinking about transferring back to my original choice, since it's a much bigger school and they offer far more than my current school in terms of extra curricular and internships. I also have a lot of friends there already, so I know I could meet people through them. Overall it's a difficult choice and although I know it's more logical to stay for freshmen year, I also don't wanna stay around and be miserable.\n\nA few reasons I'd really like to stay are that I do have a solid job where I make pretty good money and if I were to transfer I'd have to quit since it's an hour away from my current school. I could probably find a job at the other school as well, but since I just started at my current job I'd feel almost guilty for leaving.\n\nWhat I'm thinking I might do is apply as a transfer for next semester and then defer if I decide to stay, that way I could get my application and stuff done now and then give myself more time to decide.\n\nSo reddit, be brutally honest and tell me what you think?\n\nUpdate: it\u2019s been 2 months and I still hate it here lmao, I applied to the original school I was supposed to go to but haven\u2019t officially committed yet.

But I'm not sure if I should do that, I'd assume it's easy just simply to change majors, but I'm of course not very knowledgeable about this. And then the other option is I apply with my ideal major and then put the other school options I want just in case CSULB still doesn't accept me.\n\nSo what advice would you give me? Since I'm talking to my counselor about this on the 12th, and the transfer admission is coming up, I want to transfer for Fall 2023. Then also general advice for things I should be aware of cuz I really want to be prepared enough for this decision. \n\nThank You Everyone in Advance.", "title": "Transfer With The Major I Want or Major No One Picks (Switching CSU to CSU)", "id": "x9p8qo", "score": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/x9p8qo/transfer_with_the_major_i_want_or_major_no_one/", "permalink": "/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/x9p8qo/transfer_with_the_major_i_want_or_major_no_one/", "author": "YourDoodJerms", "comments": [{"id": "inrsaj6", "body": "Research the major-switching process.

However, everything I said is really for computer science students, so please *take what I wrote with a grain of salt* because it will be different for *you*.\n\n**But if you want legit advice,** I'd say do well this and next semester to raise your GPA if needed. Get good grades (maybe As and Bs?). I'm not sure if you need recommendation letters, but if you do, start asking for them now if you haven't already. Also, do stuff because *you* enjoy it, don't do it for CSULB. Another thing I would do is check out r/CSULB to get an idea of student life here. It's probably not much different from CSUDH, but still possibly worth checking out. Also, CSULB has an issue with providing AC in the Fine Arts buildings. I've heard about classes getting canceled because it's way too hot to teach/learn. The school hasn\u2019t done much about it because they don\u2019t care. Finally, *I would recommend applying for your actual major* because you may not be able to switch majors once admitted.\n\nI'm assuming you're local since you attend CSUDH.

You've done that.\n\nIt's very similar to normal college applications, but you're just doing some more paperwork. If you haven't even started your first year yet, there is a chance you could actually transfer like, now, but you will be very limited in where you can apply, and would probably lose your deposit and whatnot for the other school. Some schools will accept applications until like August though. Just a heads up.\n\nTake classes that will work for your preferred degree (like if you can slip a CS class in your schedule, do so). You may have a schedule made for you by your school but you can in fact change it even as a first semester freshman. Take at least 15 credits a semester (like 5 or so classes depending on how many credits each one is worth). That's pretty average. You shouldn't worry about needing 30 credits as long as you take a normal number of classes, and even if you weren't transferring you want to stay in that range in order to graduate \"on time\". You can kinda start applying whenever, I recommend the Coalition App or Common App, some schools may have their own application as well but it's easier to do everything in one place IMO. I think I did almost every regular college app with the Common App and then my transfers I did one with the Common App and one with the SUNY app (which I do recommend if you're in NYS).\n\nSort of winter time is a good time to do applications, you can do essays and whatnot over break and you'll have your first semester grades. Apps for \"good schools\" were generally due March to early April (Amherst, Boston College, Cornell, etcetera) so keep that in mind. You'll see the deadline. Other apps were due like May 1st, etc - of the year you plan to enter. So you're looking at applying during the spring-ish time in 2023. You can do other parts of the application now but for grades and letters of rec (some need letters of rec from college professors) you'd have to wait a bit. (This is assuming you're not transferring \\*for\\* the spring semester anywhere.)\n\nFor your app it's basically like in high school except you'll probably send transcripts like three times (HS transcript, first semester college, second semester college) (second semester may be sent after you're already accepted though). I applied to good state schools and didn't actually need letters of rec, your mileage may vary. However, that way you're not waiting on other people.\n\nBasically just do the college thing and remember to do a couple apps starting winter/spring time. That's kinda it.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "Hey all,\n\nHonestly, my college decisions process was kind of a shitshow to say the least. I had all the time in the world during break to really write out my essays, but procrastinated until the very last day for nearly all of my colleges. To be quite frank, it's one of my biggest regrets because I feel like I didn't get to describe myself well enough -- the point of essays is to encapsulate yourself to the college(s) you're applying to, but I feel as if I completely failed. I never applied with the expectation of getting into my reaches, but I also felt like I could have done way more to be prepared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThus my decision of college transferring. Of course, I'm not banking on applying and getting accepted as a transfer student. Rather, it's just one option I want to take after completing my freshman year, and if I happen to be accepted to one or more college, I'll exercise those options. However, even with some stress alleviated by knowing that I'm not planning out my undergrad experience around transferring, I still cannot help but feel anxious about this upcoming year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's already some steps that I've taken to \"maximize\" my chances as a potential transfer student. Retaking the ACT (I know, probably not going to do much, more of a clarity thing for myself), making a spreadsheet with all the due dates, possible internships, and personal projects are all things I've laid out, but even then, the whole transferring process feels *so vague*. Compared to the first year process, I feel like there is no concrete pathway that I can take, even with motivation, to really make myself a standout candidate. I *feel* motivated, but at the same time lost, not knowing really where to allocate my resources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, for those of you who plan on transferring, or have attempted (success or not) it, what will/have you done? My chances already feel so miniscule, and I feel unsatisfied not knowing which course of action to take. I know that my undergrad years will be fun regardless of the college I go to, but I at least want to have the clarity that I put in the maximum effort to apply to reaches, making up for my lackluster application season this year.

I'd love if you could give me some advice, here's my situation:\n\nI have a 4.0 unweighted GPA, 2 years' experience as a physics tutor, 2 internships at NASA JPL (totaling 2/3 of a year), and am the cofounder/VP of the Astronomy & Physics club at my school.\n\nI like my application and feel it's decent, but unfortunately when application deadlines were approaching, I was working 2 jobs, more than full time and was a full-time student also. I was feeling confident and hearing from counselors that my chances at getting into UCB were great. So I made the poor decision to only fill out the UC application and apply to UCB, UCD, UCI, and UCSC. I was definitely burnt out and had too much on my plate at the time but in hindsight it was not a good move and maybe I should have dropped something else instead and applied more widely.\n\nAt this point, I've been offered admission to UCD, UCI, and UCSC. Assuming I don't get into UCB at this point, I'm wondering if it could be worth it to delay my graduation in order to try for UCB and a host of other top schools next year.\n\nIf I did my application would become stronger, I can continue working at NASA JPL, and as a tutor in physics. I would go from having completed my requirements to having completed all requirements and recommendeds. That would just take about 6 months though so I'd have a half year just sort of trying to effectively fill time, maybe diving into programming with online courses or something else.\n\n**What do you guys think?**\n\n1. With this application, if I applied all over the country next year do you think I have a decent chance of going somewhere T20?\n2. Would it be worth it to delay my graduation by a year if it meant going to a top school?\n3. Also, I'm going for a bachelor's in physics but intend to get a masters subsequently.

I graduated hs in 2020, took a underwhelming but helpful gap year and started at DU this fall. First quarter was pretty good- found a good group of friends, felt like I was being social enough, did well in my classes. Winter quarter was rough- I was partying a lot and honestly just caught up with shitty guys, so eventually I had to medically withdraw for the quarter and go to treatment.

They might not notice during admissions but they\u2019ll definitely find out at some point during enrollment. And then your options for finishing college will be slim to none. Omitting records is a very foolish idea. \n\nI\u2019m curious why you feel ready to go to a university right now anyway, considering you\u2019re doing so poorly in community college. There\u2019s a reason for the admissions process and it\u2019s to vet students for their preparedness. You don\u2019t really seem prepared. I know you have excuses like not liking your major but who is to say that won\u2019t happen again? People change majors often. There will always be required coursework you\u2019re not interested in, part of college is figuring out how to push through and remain committed instead of \u201cdicking off\u201d. \n\nWhat you could do, what I recommend, is either taking a gap year since you\u2019re head doesn\u2019t really seem to be in the right place for college right now or/and staying at your CC. If you really want to continue, re-take any classes your got a D or F in. When you transfer you\u2019ll still have to list those grades, but they\u2019ll be disregarded from your gpa if you repeat them with a better grade. If you take another semester or two successfully, you could apply for academic renewal- which is the \u201cfresh start\u201d you\u2019re really looking for. When you get academic renewal it will disregard the bad grades you didn\u2019t repeat from your gpa. Again, the admissions officers will know you got bad grades originally but getting academic renewal shows them that your current school believes you\u2019ve turned around. \n\nYou\u2019d be surprised at how forgiving admissions can be if they see an upward trajectory.

I am a California CC student who applied as a biology major at all schools with different alternatives at each school.\n\nI have my biology, general chemistry, physics, and math sequences all complete and have started my organic chemistry sequence. This is where the trouble is - I would like to drop my current organic chemistry class and continue without it as I fear that I will be unable to pass (and if I do, it will be a C). The main reason for dropping this course is that I have to commute every week to class which takes 3 hours, which honestly drops morale for the class and kills the day as my energy the following day. Though I could have taken this at a local college, I wanted to take it at the current college which I have been able to take fully online until this current semester. Chemistry has also been historically my worst subject with each year slowly declining in grade (B+. B-, C, ...). I know this trend is bad but everything else has been fairly strong, with pretty much all classes being As. My GPA as of last fall semester is 3.57 and with this semester I will be able to have 3.64 if I drop organic chemistry. I believe I will have all units required with this drop, as currently I have 63.80 semester units (would be dropping 5.3 units with organic chemistry).

Absolutely not.\n\nYou said you're happy at your current institution. So you already got in somewhere. Applying isn't binding in either case, but there's a difference between your situation and someone who is just applying to as many colleges as they can to better their chances of getting into any of them.\n\nFirst of all, the application process for a prestigious school is incredibly rigorous. Even if you only apply to one, you're talking about at least a full-time workweek's worth of writing and rewriting. You're currently enrolled somewhere else where the quality of your work will have an actual impact on your future. Why would you want to divide that energy to work for an opportunity you have no intention of capitalizing on?\n\nSecondly, this is going to cost you money. You're going to need to send transcripts. You're going to have an application fee. You're going to have to pay for score sends (Yes, a lot of elite schools are test optional now. But transfer rates are about 1% at most of them, and you will need everything you can get to stand out.)\n\nYou're going to need recommendations. You're going to need the assistance of your guidance counselor. You will have to lie to them about your intentions, because if the school you apply to reaches out to verify any information about you, they may be obligated by professional integrity to share your motivations for applying if they are aware of them. If you do lie and you happen to get in and reject the offer, your guidance office will be aware of it. You can say you realized it would be too expensive to attend after the fact, but that's going to make your current institution think you weren't responsible enough to look up some of the most basic information about your school. You will have wasted the time of your recommenders and your guidance counselors in the interest of personal validation. You won't get kicked out of your current school for it, but if you want to go on to a graduate program in the future, you might have a harder time getting recommendations because you've cast doubt on your own intentions.\n\nAdditionally, if you're just trying to get in for an ego boost, what's your plan in the very likely event you get rejected? I'm not trying to be rude; with elite transfer acceptance rates, ALL applicants are likely to be rejected. You can say now that you wouldn't take it personally, but if this idea is on your mind at all, I wouldn't be so sure. The fact is that whatever decision you get will tell you precisely nothing about yourself. You might get rejected because they have too many residents from your state. You might get in because they don't have enough. Your AO could be having a bad day. These are just some of the caprices governing first-year applications. For a transfer app, you have another consideration: elite institutions expect you to demonstrate a clear academic need to transfer. This is not something you can fake. If you expect a stranger to be able to validate your capabilities for you, I'm not sure you have the sense of self necessary to write essays that don't sound like they're trying to conform to a preconceived expectation.\n\nThe final, and probably most important consideration is that in light of everything I've already said about transfer rates, you really shouldn't get in. I'm not saying you aren't capable or that you don't deserve it. But your acceptance could be the rejection of someone else who actually wants to go. Transfer applications often attract low income and nontraditional students--people whose lives could be drastically altered by this one opportunity. If that isn't you, please step back and leave this to the people who actually plan to do something with it.\n\nI get what you're going through and I know that it feels good to get accolades, but to go to this effort for the bragging rights alone is indicative of an inability to validate yourself without external approval. I say skip the application and ask about your current institution's mental health resources so you can address this properly.", "score": 1, "author": "t20hrowaway"}]},

Columbia's transfer admissions site says competitive applicants will have at least a 3.5 GPA.  Most other highly selective colleges are looking at similar minimums.  It's worth noting that this is the minimum - if you're below that, you aren't really competitive according to them, and many students with 4.0s will still get rejected.\n\nYou would need some other factor to entice them to admit you.  If you are an elite athlete that could help, but even then at the Ivies you would have to be academically qualified.  Ivies use an academic index for athletes and the average for each team has to be above a certain level.  So if they take an academically underqualified student, the others in their class will have to be stronger to make up for it.  They will certainly consider doing this but it's a tradeoff and they'll probably only do it for a truly outstanding athlete.\n\nOutside the Ivies, if you're looking at like Duke or Stanford or something, there's a lot more focus on just your individual athletic ability.  So for example, Duke's basketball team consistently enrolls students who would otherwise (academically) have no chance at getting into Duke (not all of them obviously).  But all of this hinges on you being a D1 starter-level athlete, which may not be the case, especially if your injury was career ending.\n\nOne final point - transfer admission to highly selective colleges is challenging and unpredictable.  Many of these schools only admit a few dozen transfers each year from a pool of thousands of applicants.  It's common for admit rates to be below 5%.  Part of this is that they have such high retention rates - since so few students leave, there just aren't many spots available for transfers.  Part of it is that they're just highly selective anyway and only admit the best and most qualified applicants (according to their admissions process and institutional goals).\n\nTo give you one concrete example, last year I had a student with a 3.5 GPA and an otherwise quite strong application apply to many T20s and a few other schools.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "so i'm thinking about transferring colleges, but i don't know if it's the right decision. on one hand, at my current school, i've made a lot of friends and have a good community here. i'm in a sorority and i'm completely in the social scene, but i'm wondering if this is the smartest decision for me. i'm bipolar 2, and i've been struggling a lot with it the last couple of months. i miss my parents and my family so much, and i want to be around them so i can have their support. but the thing is, they supported me all throughout high school and i'm starting to realize i need to learn to live without them. i have a good psychiatrist and therapist here, which is making all the difference, and if i transfer back to my home state i'll have to find a new one.\n\nthe other thing though is that i think my family might need me. my parents are so supportive and wonderful, but my dad, like me, is bipolar 2. having me around is a much needed comfort for him, as my other sibling has also left for college. i don't want him to be sad and alone, rather i'm thinking that i can be close for undergraduate, and when we're both a little more used to that, i can leave fully for graduate school. my grandparents are also close by at the school i'm considering, and i think it would be comforting for them to see me as they get older. especially my grandma, she adores having grandchildren and her not being able to see me as much is really hard on her.\n\nanother thing with the bipolar 2 diagnosis is that i'm starting to wonder if drinking like i do on the weekends is making things worse. i have so much i want to do with my life, and i'm starting to freak out a little bit at the thought of if the partying i do is going to affect me longterm. if i transfer schools i won't be in the social scene there, because at this school the social scene is completely dominated by greek life and my sorority isn't there, and when you join a sorority you can't join another. i wouldn't be in the social scene at all which means it would be pretty hard for me to make friends, and i don't want to restart with friends. i also am unsure that if i transfer i'll miss partying. what if i do and i can't anymore?\n\ntransferring would also mean a significant reduction in my tuition. this would make me feel a lot better about going to graduate school. also being close to home for my undergraduate degree would help me feel a lot more comfortable leaving my home state for a graduate degree.\n\ntransferring would also be nice for me because i love the city of where i would transfer to. it's probably my favorite place on this earth if i'm being honest, and the city where i'm currently in is fine, but i definitely don't love it. it would be amazing to be somewhere where i feel so happy to be there. i'm just sad because i think i missed that window of where it would have been acceptable for me to go there. i'm now halfway through my sophomore year, but i would be transferring next semester (i have a spot available for me). if i transferred next semester i would feel like such a failure. i would feel like everyone from my hometown would look at me like the loser who couldn't hack in another state so she came back. i would feel like i let myself down kinda, and those who supported be in high school throughout my bipolar diagnosis. those who supported me were the ones who made me feel like i could go to another state. leaving that state and coming home would just feel so awful. i felt like a loser throughout all of high school, and i don't want to anymore. i want to be a winner, someone who's doing well at life and is becoming the person i should be.\n\ni really don't know what do do, so in here's the pros and cons in case you didn't want to read all that:\n\npros: close to home (i miss my parents so fucking much), would be able to completely focus on academics, would have the support system of my family in case my bipolar disorder gets bad, the comfort i could give to my family, wouldn't feel the need to binge drink on the weekends (good for bipolar disorder), reduction in tuition, would feel better about leaving the state for graduate school, and i absolutely love the city i would be moving to.\n\ncons: i already have a support system here, maybe me and my family need to learn how to live without each other, i would have to make new friends, i would be very late for registering for classes since i would start at the new school next semester, i wouldn't be in the social scene at all, i would feel like a loser in every sense, and i would basically have to completely restart in everything.\n\nplease help. i really don't know what to do.", "title": "transferring colleges advice", "id": "r5dxdd",

Whether you \"know\" what you're doing or not you should always consult with an advisor/ask questions whenever possible. \n\nMY EXPERIENCE:\nWhat I did when I first started the transfer process was that I frequently researched all the different colleges I wanted to transfer to in my state. I took into consideration the cost, the distance, and the program of my study. I narrowed it down to a few colleges and began looking at how my credits would transfer to each one. (This is vital as a transfer student because you don't want to risk your hard earned credits not transferring properly. By making sure your credits do transfer you can look up transfer search engine (insert college here). Or also consulting/emailing an academic advisor/transfer advisor at the school you want to transfer to. )In the case that some credits don't transfer, some colleges will work with you to make it count but it's a case by case situation which is why it is so important to ask questions.  I decided to apply once I understood how my credits would transfer. Generally, to apply to a college you go to the website of that school and there will be an apply button/link it will direct you to.  \n\nThe transfer process ranges from student to student, but it can be frustrating because it feels we don't have as much guidance as opposed to traditional new incoming students (not to take away from the hardships they go through but to highlight the fact that transfers are more on their own to figure out their post secondary journeys.). College is hard enough as it is, and personally it kinda feels like I'm having to start over the beginning of the process. Although I will say I am very fortunate to be able to have the opportunity to transfer. My current school doesn't offer the degree I want to pursue and doesn't have many activities I want to partake in. Transferring would allow me to have other opportunities that my current college simply can not offer me at this time. I hope your transfer journey is smoother than mine.

When I was in senior year of high school, I didn't know what to pursue as a major because my mind was all over the place. Nonetheless, I graduated senior year of high school with a really high GPA and got admitted into UC Irvine. Starting of fall semester of 2014, I landed on computer science major and it turns out that was my biggest mistake. I didn't have passion for that major and did really poorly. I ended up with a GPA of 2.05 from just the 9 overall classes I took over there; I left in 2015 after just one year of school. I was put on academic probation after first quarter when I failed Calculus because it was a major-related class, then academic probation again in second quarter I got a D+ in Calculus and by third quarter I was told to leave the institution, since I switched out Calculus with math combinations theory class and also failed it due to health/personal reasons. I didn't do so well in my main programming classes much, hence why my GPA of 2.05 is there after freshmen year. So I left UC Irvine and started working for the first time starting summer of 2015 to help support my family. For one year, I basically worked and took a break from school. Then, I thought about my future and decided on trying to pursue biology as a major since I always had a liking for it. So in fall of 2016, I enrolled into my local community college and started knocking out classes for the major prerequisites and general education requirements. Currently, my GPA is 3.418 and have 112 semester credits. I'll have 120+ credits by end of this fall semester and I'll most likely end up with 3.5+ GPA. I ended up passing Calculus here also and took mostly a lot of science classes in fields of biology, chemistry, and physics. I'm planning to transfer this fall semester and apply to as many Cal State Universities as I can. I have finished almost all major prerequisites according to [assist.org](https://assist.org) and have just left one class left.

I realized I\u2019m not likely to get into dental school & I\u2019m just no longer interested in attempting to go that route. I want to pursue dental hygiene instead but I\u2019m not sure what to do. I\u2019m currently a senior and about 20 credits from completing the degree. I\u2019m not sure if I should just complete the degree and then apply to a college that has a dental hygiene major / program - but if I do that will the core English, math, science classes I took transfer and count or do I have to take them again? I\u2019m so close to being done with the degree but idk if it would be worth it to waste my time and money to hold a degree I\u2019m never going to use. Is it even possible to transfer schools and change majors as a senior?

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "Hi everyone! I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me some advice pertaining to my situation. I was waitlisted at Cornell\u2019s College of Arts & Sciences this year. However, Cornell is a school that is very personal to me for a variety of reasons, and I would really like to join Cornell\u2019s campus community and engage in my college experience as a Cornellian. \n\nBasically, I was wondering whether you all think it would be best for me to transfer into Arts & Sciences (which has a very low transfer rate/I wasn\u2019t offered a TO) or to try my luck at the College of Human Ecology. I\u2019m a current psychology major and applied as a psych major to Arts & Sciences, however, would apply as a Human Development major at Human Ec. Both these majors have concentrations that excite and interest me greatly. However, I\u2019d like to maximize my chances as a transfer. Do you think being waitlisted would help me at Arts & Sciences or would you recommend me to try Human Ec? Additionally, my twin sister was offered a TO at Human Ec, (of course we would like to go to college together/we also co-lead initiatives together) therefore, would applying to her school help me or hurt both our chances to ur knowledge? \n\nAdditionally, the reason I\u2019d like to transfer to Cornell and have an interest in it in the first place is because my dad went to Cornell. My relationship with my dad is not one that is stable & hasn\u2019t been my entire childhood, however, the time we spent parading around Cornell and exploring its buildings and surrounding community has been some of the most memorable and positive childhood memories that I share w/ him & in general. Specifically, my interest in psychology stems from my relationship with him and his abusive childhood. I\u2019d like to gain insight to the factors during childhood that impact psychopathology. For my transfer essay, I\u2019d probably explain this interest & where it stems from and how I believe Cornell can best help me achieve this passion. However, do you think I should avoid writing how beyond academic reasons, I\u2019d like to attend Cornell to further understand my dad, to learn and grow at a school and in a campus community he was apart of, to reclaim parts of my past & to finally receive closure\u2026 All in all, I don\u2019t want to walk my dad\u2019s path, but create my own- I just hope that my time at Cornell will help me gain the insight that I need.  Again, I\u2019m hesitant to share this b/c idk how admissions will perceive it.

Next, find something that you are interested in pursuing and try it out, it might be something you would want to pursue at a larger scale at NYU or Columbia.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "Hello people. Before I start, I'd like to clarify that I'm only 16 y/o, and I might be worrying too much(?). I'm currently a high school student studying in Malaysia. I don't have the faintest idea about colleges or universities. I\u2019m planning on studying abroad, but I don't know which institution or country I will go to. With that being said, please provide me as much info as you possibly can. And don't you worry, if I don't understand something, I will Google it and then continue to ask if I still have any inquiries. I know the answers to educational questions differ depending on one\u2019s situation, so feel free to ask me more about myself.\n\nAlright.\n\nFirst of all, my academic results are average and I\u2019m not a very fast-learner. Thus, I am one who needs to put in a ton of effort to be good at a certain subject (I am aware that most, if not all, high-achievers rely on hard work). However, I tend to divert my attention to aspects other than academics, I usually spend my time playing games (albeit much less now) or creating my game. So, I don't spend much time on my academics, and my results are starting to worry me. I know it matters, but to what extent? I don\u2019t know. So that's my first question.\n\nSecond of all, I am more focused on developing my own game right now (project-based learning) and it is what I'm worrying about. I used to work on a lot of little projects before I started learning game development, and all of them have gone missing together with my 16GB USB stick last year (that's when I started using GitHub/GitLab). But now, I spend too much time creating even just a single asset for my game which is a pretty bad situation. I don't think I\u2019ll even be halfway done by next year, even though I'm making steady progress day by day. This is not looking good for me but should I just focus on the progress instead of quality? Is portfolio important nowadays anyway? Should I focus on building my own portfolio over academic results?\n\nThird of all, I am gonna talk about what I learned. Let's go back to 2 years ago when I started to learn Java. It was too difficult for me to understand (that's when I got Java-phobia XD) and so I started to learn website development instead. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP, and I joined a few competitions (2 or 3, inside my school, competing against other students) using what I learned. I won most of them, and that's when I found out that website development is not for me. The way CSS works was just so frustrating, it never went my way. So, I picked up C++, CLang, Python and some graphic designing skills from there. It's all fun and interesting until I was first addicted to an FPS shooter game (after I got a new PC). That's when everything started to spiral downhill. I started playing all day long during the period of quarantine and it's hard to control myself. I stopped last year when I realized that I can't keep going on this way. So I started to pick up game development, and I want to apply my C++ knowledge, so I used Unreal Engine 4 for my game. And then, I started learning Blender and Substance Painter, finding my way through until today, where I'm still learning about them (project-based learning). I don't really know if a Game Design degree is actually worth it or not (I am pretty sure there's one, right?), and I don't know what to go for. And for now, should I focus on improving all aspects or just specific ones? So that\u2019s another question.\n\nEven after I know what I should go for, I don't know where and which college/university I should go for. I would prefer to study overseas (preferably Australia, UK, etc), also to meet more people (I'm an introvert, it'll be a massive leap for me), and experience a diversity of cultures if possible. If I have a goal, I am willing to do everything I can to go there. But the expenses are also something I should be worrying about. My family probably can't afford to let me study overseas (unless they secretly save up for me or something, which is probably not the case), and my savings are not much either. I can work to earn some money there while I'm studying. But, there's still a budget limit since I probably won't earn that much money doing some part-time work. There's an alternative, that's to apply for a scholarship, but how do I do it? As I said, I know nothing about this. Treat me as an absolute idiot and please give me as much info as you can. I would like to know more about scholarships for Game Design/Computer Science (or even 3d digital art if it's available). And from what I know, scholarships kinda tie you with a specific college, right? If so, I hope I can apply for one that can give me more possibilities to choose (free to make my own decisions). So, what are the recommendations?\n\nThere are just so many questions yet to be answered, and I'm really serious about this. I hope this is the subreddit for it, and thanks in advance.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nI'm 16, a high school student in Malaysia, worrying a lot about my future (cuz I know nothing about it) and would like to ask for some advice. I learned website development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP), software development (C++, CLang, Python), graphics designing (Photoshop, Illustrator) and I'm learning about game development right now (project-based learning, Blender, Substance Painter, Unreal Engine 4). Here are my questions:\n\n* Is portfolio important for a game developer nowadays? Should I focus on building my own portfolio over academic results?\n* I know how to do a lot of things, what degree should I go for? Is a Game Design degree worth it? Does it exist? Any college/university recommendations?

I realized I don't really wanna go the biology route but I'd rather go the oceanography route but I am planned to take Orgo and Bio next year. UCSD is my top choice and I was planning on applying as an AOS (Atmospheric and Oceanic Science) major but the articulation agreement has Physics 1-3 (Calc Based), 1 year of Gen Chem, and Calc through Linear algebra and Diff equations. I have two options: 1) Keep my plan and just apply and a marine bio major or 2) Drop orgo and bio next year to take Phys 3 (waves and that stuff)  and take diff equations. The thing is I could keep my plan and still possibly be considered for the AOS major because if I drop all my Bio/Orgo courses, that means all my safety schools are jeopardized because none of them have a major this specific. Should I keep my plan and apply as an AOS major knowing I'm not as strong of a candidate or should I drop orgo and to take 1 extra semester of physics and become a stronger candidate?  For reference, UCSD is my top choice. \n\nRelevant Courses taken:\n\n1 year gen chem \n\n1 year calc + will be taking multi in the fall\n\n1 sem of phys+ will be takin phys 2 this summer\n\n1 sem of gen bio+ will be taking 2nd sem this fall\n\nwill be taking 1 year of orgo\n\nAnything helps :)\n\nFor reference I plan to pursue grad school to study something maybe with cyanobacteria, hydrothermal vents, marine microbiology, marine chemistry, or something that does not involve ANIMALS exactly and is actually \"useful\"", "title": "UCSD Transfers--Anyone major in AOS?", "id": "ngs6c6", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/ngs6c6/ucsd_transfersanyone_major_in_aos/", "permalink": "/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/ngs6c6/ucsd_transfersanyone_major_in_aos/", "author": "ucassotozono", "comments": []},

The process wasn\u2019t exactly fun but I got through it and got accepted everywhere I applied. \n\nThis semester has been drastically different.

I\u2019m struggling to find the motivation to even get out of my bed. \n\nThe most challenging classes have been my math classes (business calculus and microeconomics). I was supposed to graduate highschool in 2006 and didn\u2019t but I feel like students today are being prepared so much more with new AP courses and other college prep and it\u2019s making it hard for me to keep up with them. Math has always been something I\u2019ve been good at. I got a 99% in my statistics class and have A\u2019s in all my other math classes but as I continue to progress I find myself stuck. \n\nI reached out to both professors, went to office hours and still feel pretty lost in calc. In my Econ class I feel like I learn how to do a problem but then on the test the problem will include some kind of variable that changes the way it\u2019s solved and then I\u2019m not able to follow the same steps that I took when practicing if that makes sense.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": "**This might ramble a bit, but here we go:**\n\nHello all! I'm a freshman year student looking for advice. In my first two quarters I was dead-set on transferring to my second choice school. I'm having some second thoughts now.\n\nI pretty much based my initial opinions on my campus visits. When I visited the school I'm attending, I was with my entire family and I had never been to that part of the country before. We spent a weekend in the city with the best weather possible, and the school itself became an afterthought in relation to the trip itself. When I visited the second school, I had a terrible experience. It was snowing, I had a fever, and we had to rush from every location to get to the airport (I don't even think we finished the tour). Despite this, I really loved the campus and the city it was in. I had a lot of friends going there as well. \n\nBoth schools offered me the same amount of money, but I ended up choosing the first school because they were allowing students on campus with online learning. The second school did not allow students back on campus for the first semester, but opened up in the second. Both schools are mid-sized Jesuit schools in big cities with very liberal student bases.\n\nThe first two quarters were rough. Making friends became a challenge because my school did not offer any in person activities (they still don't). Most of the friends I had made were from my floor in the dorm or from chance by meeting in the dining hall (one of the only open buildings on campus) after class. This became worse in my second quarter as numerous students moved off campus. I got back into my second choice school with the money they originally offered, and I was very confident in my decision to move on. Mistakenly, I told my friends who attend the second school that I had made my decision final. I told my friends at the first that I was pretty sure I was leaving. \n\nWhen I came home for spring break, I was certain I wanted to transfer, but when I got back this quarter things started improving. As other students got vaccinated and the sun started to shine, my experience improved a lot. I started meeting more people and going out much more than I had in the first semester. \n\nHowever, I still don't like a lot about my school. I don't really like our campus. Our administration is strict about covid, which I understand, but they're clearly unsupportive of the students that are here. Like a lot of freshmen this year, I feel like I've been scammed. (I should have taken a gap year, but it does me no good to criticize myself from hindsight). I have a small, but pretty close group of friends at my current school, but I'm much more comfortable around my friends at the other. Additionally, the second school is much closer to home and I also have family there. \n\nIn general, I feel like I made the wrong initial decision. If I was to go back in time to last year, I would have chosen the second. However, with the uncertainty of covid at the time and my positive memories of the visit, I chose 1st. Now that I have some friends and things are starting to open up, I'm having second thoughts. \n\nShould I stay? Should I leave? Should I take a gap year? If you have any thoughts or ways to decide, feel free to respond. Thanks!\n\n**TLDR: I was going to transfer from the school I'm currently attending because of the lack of student engagement, challenges in finding friends, etc., but I am currently having second thoughts. Both schools are fairly similar in price, size, and environment, but the second is much closer to home. I feel like I made the wrong initial decision in going to the school I'm attending, but I've made some friends.

My weak point was definitely my grades. \n\nMy CGPA at the end of junior year I believe was a 3.31. I didn\u2019t do very well freshman year, mostly because I wasn\u2019t trying. I did better sophomore year, but still not great. Junior year I was doing very well initially, but then COVID hit and my fourth quarter grades tanked my GPA, as I could not focus at home. This year started off pretty poorly (I have an extremely hard time with remote learning), so I\u2019m currently digging myself out of the hole I dug first semester. My teachers went easy on me, but my first semester senior grades were not that great. \n\nI was rejected from WashU and Harvey Mudd, and I was waitlisted at Carnegie Mellon, Haverford, and Carleton. I've narrowed my current choices to Reed, University of Rochester, and Brandeis. I like each of these schools, but I was hoping to graduate from somewhere a little more prestigious to help my chances at getting into a top grad school (I am going to major in physics and probably double major in math).\n\nIf I go to one of the colleges on my list freshman year and get all A's, would that in conjunction with my 36 put me within spitting range of an elite university? I was thinking somewhere like Cornell, Johns Hopkins, or WashU, as I see they have favorable transfer acceptance rates compared to freshman rates, and perhaps other schools like UCLA, UC Berkely, Notre Dame, UMichigan, etc. I would assume transferring to a dream school like Yale or University of Chicago sophomore year is unrealistic.\n\nThanks.", "title": "What might my transfer prospects be at elite universities in the future?", "id": "muhfj5", "score": 6, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/muhfj5/what_might_my_transfer_prospects_be_at_elite/", "permalink": "/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/muhfj5/what_might_my_transfer_prospects_be_at_elite/", "author": "a_philosophiliac", "comments": [{"id": "gv6587b", "body": "Since when isn\u2019t UC Berkeley a dream school for physics?...", "score": 2, "author": "LacunaWanderers"}, {"id": "gv8yre2", "body": "Why are you only looking into 'elite universities?'", "score": 0, "author": "khielo"}, {"id": "gvdoapz", "body": "Just thought I\u2019d let you know that UCs heavily favor in-state transfers specifically from California Community Colleges.

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": " Throwaway account because this is a lot of personal info.\n\nI'm a college sophomore right now, but since high school I've had a lot of trouble figuring out what I want to do. I initially applied to a pretty expensive out-of-state school (UIUC) because I wanted to get away from my family (nothing wrong with them, just my teenage angst, we get along very well now haha) AND it had a good program for my major, mostly. In hindsight, though, high school senior me was really dumb.\n\nAfter freshman year, I realized that I wanted to major in graphic design instead, and changed my major. But now, because of that, I think I should consider transferring to an in-state school (in California). Here are my reasons:\n\n1. It will most likely be a lot cheaper, saving me tens of thousands of dollars, although money is not the main reason why I want to transfer. I do hear that it isn't worth going out-of-state for an art degree.\n2. Going to an in-state art school (Cali has a lot of these) will most likely have a better program for a career in graphic design, although I don't know how much of a difference it will make.\n3. I miss my home state, and traveling between my college and my family's home is is an exhausting, expensive hassle (4-hour flight, sometimes requiring multiple stops, then a 4-hour bus ride, not to mention the 2-hour time difference) that I really hate having to do multiple times a year.\n\nPotential reasons against transferring:\n\n1. I currently don't have a very developed portfolio in terms of graphic design, although I have a lot of other work (illustration, drawings, etc.)\n2. This is a really big decision, and I don't know if I'm just being wishy-washy and should just stay the course. It's always easier to stay where I am.\n3. I'm not sure if it's already too late!\n\nAre these reasons enough to justify transferring schools? When is the point of no return?", "title": "Help!

    {"subreddit": "CollegeTransfer", "body": " \n\nFirst  off, let me start by saying that I know the dismal odds of getting in  to these schools as a transfer student (1-2%) and that even the best  qualified candidates need to get lucky. I'm just hoping for your  opinions on my app.\n\nSecond, a  little background/reference info. I'm 16 and graduated high school when I  was 11. I attended a liberal arts \"early college\"  when I was 12 but,  as you'll see, didn't do too well and left. Currently live in Florida  and take non-degree classes at the nearby university.\n\nThird, I know transfer students probably don't come here often but any thoughts help! Thanks.\n\n**Demographics:** White Male (low(ish) income, single immigrant mother)\n\n**Intended Major(s):**  Chemical Engineering\n\n**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** *(all taken last year)* **ACT** \\- 36 ; **SAT** 1570 (800 M, 770 R); **Subject Tests** 800 (Chemistry and Math II)\n\n**GPA:** (*bit confusing*) **High Schoo**l GPA 4.0/4.0 (graduated 2016) and Point University  4.0/4.0 (dual enrollment, 2016); **Bard College at Simon's Rock** GPA: 3.034/4.0 (3 semesters- 2016/17); **Florida Atlantic University** 3.97/4.0 (non-degree \\~20 credits, 2019-present)\n\n**Coursework:**   Basically up to Calculus III + linear algebra; done with Orgo II this  semester; two semesters comp sci/writing/ physics. (I should also  mention that I never took a single AP class or test in my life. My high  school didn't offer them.  I did do dual enrollment and was rather...  accelerated so that should probably make up for that.)\n\n**Extracurriculars:**   Music is a very strong extracurricular of mine (I suppose it better be  because it's the only one I have, besides research). I've played piano  since I was four and have played in the White House and on AGT (made it  to quarterfinals). I've won several international piano competitions and  played multitudes of concerts all over the world. Most of these  concerts/comps were done when I left Bard. I also performed a concerto  with an orchestra at Alice Tully Hall (very prestigious performing hall  in NYC) when I was 13. I have attended Julliard and New England  conservatory pre-college programs. I'm submitting arts portfolios with  all of my apps.\n\nI've been  working/volunteering as a full-fledged undergraduate researcher at a  chemistry research lab at FAU (for credit) since I was 15. I don't have  any papers that my name is on but that might change sometime this year. I  also have a high school student shadowing me on my research that I  recruited for what it's worth.\n\nAlso,  I've taught a lot the past 2 years from FAU students in GenChem when I  was 14 to the middle school students I volunteer tutor in math, etc.  around 10 hrs a week.\n\n**Awards:**  (I know that bunch of this stuff probably doesn't fit the usual awards,  but hey it's what I got. So that means, unfortunately, no science/math  Olympiads or any of that usual high school stuff because I was too busy  with piano and my studies. My high school also wasn't very large and  didn't have many resources. My mother is an immigrant from Russia and so  knows absolutely nothing about the American high school/college process  except \"Harvard good\"... lol)\n\nPiano: As I said above, good amount of highly prestigious comps, concerts, festivals, and the like.\n\nThis  one's a cool one.  During one of my piano concerts at some big event, I  met Steve Wozniak (the co-founder of Apple). We had dinner together  after and he wrote a letter of recommendation about me to Tim Cook (true  story) and I attended WWDC 2016 as a special guest of Mr. Cook. So,  there's that.\n\nI was on the second season of a game show on Lifetime called \"Child Genius\" and won the show and 100k.\n\nI've  been on several TV shows including The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Queen  Latifah show, Doctors, Superkids (a German AGT basically), and the AGT  and Child Genius ones mentioned above. I was also a double for the  little kid in Anchorman 2 (with Will Ferrell) because the actor couldn't  actually play the piano.\n\nI also  have a smattering of local awards I got during high school such as being  the Grand Marshall of my hometown's July 4th parade (pop. 35k) and my  home county's (Fayette County, in Georgia) board of commisioners issuing  a proclamation designating May 26th as Adrian Romoff Day (might as well  know my name, there's enough info here to figure that out via google).\n\n**Essays/LORs/Other:**  I'm not good at rating my own essays but I've always been rather decent at writing so I'd say maybe 6-7/10.\n\nI have three rec letters\n\n**1:**  Chemistry Professor from Bard. We got along really well and I  transferred to her as my academic advisor (difficult to do as she only  accepted one/two new students a semester; she had to really like you).  Don't know what she wrote but probably pretty good.\n\n**2:**  One of my piano teachers (happens to be a professor at FAU). I have a  much more prestigious piano professor that I study with more but she  counts as an academic recommendation since she's a professor at FAU. And  its not like the admissions committee will know the difference in  prestige between the two professors. She let me see the letter she wrote  and I'd say 6/10.\n\n**3:**  My Research Professor (aka director of our lab). He let me see the  letter he wrote too and dang, I was not expecting such a good  recommendation letter. I'm really thankful for that letter because it  was a banger. Definitely 10/10.  Said I was \" the most academically  talented undergraduate student that I have encountered at FAU.\"\n\n**Schools:**  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, UPenn, MIT, and Stanford\n\nThanks for reading this and I look forward to reading your comments!\n\n(If you want to listen to some of my piano recordings here's my yt channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hFNL7b1PC84eayaAofveQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hFNL7b1PC84eayaAofveQ))", "title": "Thoughts on chances for Prospective Transfer to Ivy/ Ivy Plus (repost from r/chanceme)", "id": "mqcwzc", "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/mqcwzc/thoughts_on_chances_for_prospective_transfer_to/", "permalink": "/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/mqcwzc/thoughts_on_chances_for_prospective_transfer_to/", "author": "DarthAnnihilus", "comments": [{"id": "guf9yin", "body": "Decent chance at UPenn. \n\nDifficult for HYS but that\u2019s because they accept like 10 kids a year.

I have a job on campus thats very flexible, they have a good program for my major, and also the program for my minor is great and not available at a lot of other schools. Unfortunately with covid, a ton of my friends have also decided to transfer/leave school, which sucks. The school is also a huge Greek life school, which I am not apart of and looking to be apart of (i dropped an organization a year ago after a bad experience). I feel like if you are not in Greek life there, it\u2019s very hard to make friends, especially now that I am older and would be living off campus if I went back. I am currently looking at other public schools in my state and a few private schools to maybe transfer too, but I am very torn. Should I suck it up and continue to attend this school, or should I look to transfer? I only have two years left, so that is why part of me is thinking I should just stay, but I dont want to continue having an unhappy college experience", "title": "debating to transfer", "id": "mmk4rf", "score": 3, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/mmk4rf/debating_to_transfer/", "permalink": "/r/CollegeTransfer/comments/mmk4rf/debating_to_transfer/", "author": "Dramatic_Size_5889", "comments": []},

I am like 95% sure that your guys' opinions/thought on the matter will not change my decision, but I just want my first-world problem to be heard.\n\nI will be transferring to a UNI this fall after serving my 2 years at a community college. I got into both schools I really want to go to, thankfully. Now it is choosing time. Both are good for my business admin major. And considering that I got two years under my belt, it is I am not looking for something to give be the best \u201ccollege lifestyle\u201d\n\nI can either go to a decently reputable and local school that lies 30 miles from where I live. There are many benefits to choosing this UNI, including that it is 60 miles closer and in that I will not have to move (I will say why that is big). Save myself the hassle of the and all the stress of financial complications and social readjustment and what not of overall \"new city\" life. I will still have friends and family close. (Again, I will explain why that is big too).\n\nOR!!! There's school B; The better school. I guess that benefit there would by that I can proudly flaunt my alma matter in my resume after graduation. Do note, however, that school B does not exactly put school A to shame or anything. Really all it is is just a more difficult school to get into.\n\n\\*\\*\\*FYI, the schools I am on about are CSU's, and not even the polytechnics either. I guess I am just a bit embarrassed that I am making such a fuss about schools that more than half the country will not even give a second thought. But hey, at least I will not be in crippling debt once this ride is over.\n\nAlso, I am a first-generation college student whose part of a family yet to have seen income of more than 25k a year for past 40 years, and whose parents are fresh off the border from Mexico and who dropped out in 2nd grade (both). So, my standards have been low since the get-go. \\*\\*\\*\n\nAlrighty, why is it important that I not move? This time next year my parents will be back in Mexico. And I will take over rent and start living by myself for the first time. Does not matter which school I choose; I am going to be 100% independent for the first time. I know I'll be safe from homelessness or anything like that wherever I go, but it would be nice to remain in a city I know my way around. And in short, I have fucked up my childhood to the point where I need friends and family to be close. Not because I plan to leach off them. I just want to know I can go to them. And so, by staying put, I know I will be calmer. I will not have panic attacks or anything of the sort if I move to school B, but I just know I will not have anyone I love nearby. I got my cats too. They are important too.\n\nDo note, again, that I am not trying to make school B a school I will not even consider. I would not be writing this if there were not any doubts in my head.\n\nThe more I write this the more stupid I feel since the choice is pretty obvious and I get the feeling most people will be like \"yeah, dude. Just stay put and be happy\". Truth is, I don't know all there is to know about college and all the other benefits that the untrained eye misses. All I know is that some schools are tougher to get into for a reason, and I'm passing up the chance to go to a better school.

The main question is when I apply to a University, do I have to include those years that I did poorly because honestly it was around 4-5 years ago and I got a fresh start on college and I do well now.

I have been looking to transfer and major in Math and Philosophy (likely Ethics), but I have some questions. \n\nI will have roughly 45 credits by the end of this semester, but only about a 3.3 GPA.

I do think reaching like this is getting to be genuinely unhealthy, so I would appreciate some good fit schools that are still decent for the two above disciplines and CompSci.

I started at my CC in my senior year of high school (by the way, will that be counted toward my HS or CC education?). I was also essentially working a part- and full-time job that year and two full-time most of the next, but I'm unsure if a college would look kinder on my Bs and C that I earned in that time, especially due to me being a part-time student.

I wasn\u2019t aware that once I submitted that application, that for future submissions I couldn\u2019t edit anything. I now wish I had never submitted that application because then I wouldn\u2019t be in the spot I am now, having to look at the mistakes I\u2019ve made and knowing I can\u2019t change them, while being so irritated thinking that if only I hadn\u2019t submitted that one application that everything would be peachy.\n\nSo...\nIn the additional information section, I answered \u201cyes\u201d to the two questions that ask if I\u2019ve been affected by COVID/natural disasters and if I want to elaborate. While filling out the application, I wrote \u201cytyr\u201d and \u201cjjj\u201d as a placeholder for my explanations, until I could get around to writing a thorough answer.\n\nI didn\u2019t care that much about the school I submitted my first application to. I didn\u2019t even submit letters of recommendation. I certainly didn\u2019t even care enough to download my application and check it before I submitted it. \n\nBut how do I address this with the prestigious schools I\u2019m applying to that I actually care about? I\u2019ve sent emails asking about this to the admissions assistants of the schools I\u2019m applying to but with no reply. I understand why I wouldn\u2019t receive a reply; this is such a foolish scenario.\n\nBut yeah.\n\nI\u2019m just...so upset. I\u2019m being forced to submit an application that has these horrible typos. I\u2019m aware of these typos. I\u2019ve been aware of these typos for weeks. This isn\u2019t oversight on my part. I\u2019m aware of these mistakes and I can\u2019t change them, but my applications to these schools are going to look like I just didn\u2019t care because of these typos. \n\nI basically want to do something that shows that I\u2019m aware that I made a mistake, that this isn\u2019t oversight, and I want to properly answer the questions.
