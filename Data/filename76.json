There may be one or two questions that require actual science learning, for example F11 had one about cell walls and worms (worms don\u2019t have one). They require deductive reasoning and even if it\u2019s an unknown vocab word like heterotroph the answer will likely have a semicolon to give you a better chance at guessing correctly. \nEx: heterotroph; the animal only consumes organic material not animals. (This eliminates 2 answer choices, so then it comes down to your reasoning)\n\nFor the other parts, you need to read very carefully. The questions I would get tripped up on are questions about particular graphs, tables, or scientists. Make sure you know what value is on what axis and so on. The whole point of this section is to trip you up on subtle differences. \n\nMy advice that works well is to make use of your pencil and always circle so you don\u2019t misread something. Bu this I mean if a question asks about \u201cIn graph 2\u201d or \u201cIn element NaCl\u201d (in a table of 10 rows) make sure you circle it because  you will bounce back and forth between reading  the question and specific information. You don\u2019t want to lose points by reading row 8 instead of row 9, so circle then erase each question\u2019s information.", "score": 1, "author": "StyleNo6653"}, {"id": "jidakhj", "body": "Practice", "score": 1, "author": "jdigitaltutoring"}]},

It\u2019s all about interpreting data and problem solving. Everything you need is on the test.

If you struggle with time, don\u2019t read just attack the graphs first and then if any questions are found in reading, read it. Personally, I don\u2019t struggle with time on this section and I find it more helpful to read and then answer questions. You can figure out which one works for you by doing some practices and see which strategy scores better. Also, while taking practice tests after you finish evaluate why you got questions wrong. If there\u2019s a pattern between tests, solve the issue. Also, I\u2019d suggest looking at your actual tests and seeing your percentage thing (idk what it\u2019s called) to see what area you\u2019re struggling the most with. You can probably find some practice tests online that are just that area. If possible, I\u2019d recommend buying the TRI if possible.

First, Google \"released ACT test\" and find a somewhat recent (within the last 6 years) test to take. If possible, print out the test and take it paper-and-pencil, and follow the official timing (you can use a free [video proctor](https://youtu.be/zZ1GlWnBCDA) lto help with that).\n\nOnce you are done, you need to do 3 things:\n1. Score your test using the answer key and scoring scale that goes with your specific test. To get your Composite score (the big score everyone cares about) you just average your English, Math, Reading, and Science scores, then round to the nearest whole number (halves round up).\n\n2. Do some research on the schools you are interested in to see how you compare. An easy way to do this is to Google the school followed by \"common data set,\" then pick the most recent year available. This will tell you what the school considers during applications and what the applicants/students submitted. MAKE SURE to look at the students, not the applicants! You want to make sure you look like one of their typical students, which is almost always more competitive than the applicant pool. If you already have a competitive score, you're done! Otherwise, you now know how much work you have to do. \n\n3. REVIEW YOUR TEST! Once you know how much improvement you need, you need to figure out what you can improve. Reviewing your test is a great learning opportunity (learning how to do the problems you missed) but it is SO MUCH MORE! You can see the stuff you're good at (to make sure you prioritize those on test day) and the stuff you need to work on (so you don't waste time on stuff you don't know how to do).\n\nAt this point you are prepared to make a plan: do you need to do nothing? Do you need comprehensive prep? Do you just need to study one subject? Do you need to hire an expert to get you to your desired score?\n\nSome people need lots of help, some just need to watch a few YouTube videos. Once you have an idea of how much improvement you need, and considering how you learn best, you can make a decision.\n\nAs long as you get moving, you got this.

For me, I was cramming but i think my routine would still be effective long term.\nFirst, I would take a benchmark act test, really simulate test conditions and keep your allotted time strict. The day after, grade your benchmark and really dive into what and why you missed the questions you did.\nFor the next study sessions, focus on individual sections, doing one section a day, then next session, grading and reviewing it. I would do this until I had all 4 sections complete, then I would do another full benchmark test.\nOnce you do enough of these study cycles, you\u2019ll be able to pick out consistent problems in your test taking if you are truly analyzing your mistakes. Then, focus on fixing these problems in the way that works best for you whether it be accuracy or time.\nThen, once you\u2019ve tested and made sure that these problems are sufficiently dealt with, ease back into the study cycle mentioned earlier. Once you can deal with your previous problems while taking sections or the test as a whole, you\u2019ll want to transition to only taking full length tests and coasting off that until test day.\nGiven our different time constraints, adjust your study sessions accordingly. In the beginning, a completion, grading, and analysis of a section every three days is decent. However, when you take a full test, really try to complete it in one sitting. Also, when you analyze your mistakes, don\u2019t make it surface level. Go into your psyche and find out what caused you to miss the question, and what you can do to get a similar question right the next time. \nFor my individual subject areas I\u2019ll share what helped me the most:\nEnglish: learn grammatical structures and what makes something grammatically incorrect like types of punctuation or phrasing. Then, when I\u2019m reading something I try to look for these rules: it helps me lock in the information.\nMath: for every question which you are confused by, learn how to solve it. For me, the math section has always been variable and often exposes the cracks in people\u2019s learned math like forgotten material from pre calc and before. For example, I didn\u2019t know what a residual was (the difference between a plot point and the line of best fit) and had no chance of getting the question right without guessing. If you encounter a math problem with concepts you\u2019ve never learned before, take the time and actually learn them. I\u2019ve found that the answer explanations in the book are very helpful.\nReading: make sure to improve your reading speed and absorption. Also, improving your test taking strategy will be important here.\nScience: waste no time: don\u2019t read the passage first, read the question first and find the information in the passage. When dealing with visual graphics, make sure you know what units and how the chart/table is arranged.\nHope you found this helpful but I doubt anyone is readin allat", "score": 2, "author": "Finnanutinyabutt"}]},

I recommend only using official ACT tests from previous years and I have a couple that I can dm. \n\nFor the English section, I never read the passage fully. I just read the underlined portions and as I read I answer the questions. It saves a ton of time- I usually have like 10-20 minutes left by the time I finish and that time is extremely helpful. Some rules for the English is that semi-colons and periods are the same and commas and dashes are the same. The best advice I have is to do as many English sections as possible, you\u2018ll learn the rules as you go. I\u2019ve never studied for the English and I do fine on them.\n\nFor the math, repetition is also important but there\u2019s some things you do have to remember (circumference and area of circles, 180\u00b0 for triangles, and a few other formulas that you can look up) but for the most part, again, this section is just about being comfortable with ACT style questions. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to only do questions/tests from the official tests. I\u2019ve also noticed the first 20 or so questions on the math are similar if not identical to other tests, so getting familiar with the questions will help a lot.\n\nThe reading and science sections are pretty similar. They may seem challenging, but remembering that the answer to all of the questions is literally right on the page helps. In the reading section, I recommend not reading the passage fully. The first and last sentences of each paragraph, with a little skimming of the middle, is all you need. By the time you go to the questions, it\u2019ll either direct you to a specific place (ex. lines 35-40) or it will ask about a broad idea that should\u2019ve been established in those first and last sentences. The science section is similar because you don\u2019t need to read everything. If there\u2019s a question that asks about student\u2019s opinions or something you can skim. For everything else, there should tables and graphs and that should be all you need. Reading takes up too much time and time is the most important thing for science section. Remember, every answer should be glaringly obvious. So if you\u2019re unsure of an answer, keep looking because it will be there. \n\nIf there\u2019s one piece of advice you\u2019ll take, let it be this: only take official ACT tests to practice and just keep taking tests. The ACT has patterns for each section and with more testing you get more comfortable and familiar. You don\u2019t have a ton of time since the test is tomorrow, but if you retake, this advice will be useful. For tomorrow, I\u2019d look up math ACT formula sheets and memorize them, get comfortable with the calculator, maybe look up basic grammar rules, and even do some practice questions the ACT has on their official website.

Otherwise I would not expect doing multiple practice tests to help nearly as much as it can.\n\nBut also, if you're not ready to achieve at the level you're really capable of, then you're not ready.

For around half of the questions you don't even need to read the passage (for example, the \"this word in line x most closesly means what\" type questions). \n\n\n2) Don't fixate on one question for more than 1 minute. In the case you do keep on moving and come back to it at the end. \n\n\n3) For almost every question, the answer will be CLEARLY written out in the passage itself.

Now my parents are saying I should take the SAT, but I am not sure if this would help when applying to colleges. Is there any reason I should take the SAT? I have searched on the internet but often found conflicting information. I know one reason is that taking the SAT could potentially improve one's score, but in my case, there is nothing higher than a 36 so the SAT would not help with this. Some other sources have said that there is no point in taking both, and submitting both would not provide any advantage. I have also read that taking the SAT increases the chance of scholarships. Is it true that taking the SAT increases the chance of scholarships, or could I get the same scholarships with the ACT alone?

(The actual amount of time is 8.75, but you want to leave yourself sometime so that on the test day you have time to do a quick answer check)\n\nFor English that means: - You have exactly 9 minutes for one passage\n\nFor Science: - Science doesn\u2019t have a standard number of questions per passage, so you\u2019ll have to do the math before you start but you have .875 seconds per question. - Don\u2019t read the information just answer the w questions and find info when you need it.\n\nIf you are running out of time: - do one full length test every weekend, so you have some practice.\n\nEven if you have ample time, I would recommend taking one or two full length practices before you sit for another ACT bc then you can make sure the timing works.

I know a lot of people say to do x questions in 20 minutes. I personally like to calculate how much time to spend on each question in order to have a few minutes to review at the end to catch dumb mistakes\n\n\\- For reading and science: it HAS to be in the passages. if it's not in there, it isn't the right answer. Thankfully, the content of the ACT is easier than the SAT, so process of elimination is going to be your friend. \n\n\\- Always remember that there is ONE right answer. Doesn't matter if they say \"best fit\" or anything like that. There will always be one reason that an answer will be unmistakably wrong (again, process of elimination is big here)\n\n\\- Science section: go fast. This is where calculating time per question comes in handy: I managed to have 9 minutes to review my science answers, (which was kinda crazy for me too). And do conflicting viewpoints last, its generally going to take the longest. \n\n\\- If you're going to guess, always have a reason for it. Sure, some people pick C all the time. In reading, look for connections to an overarching theme or style. In math, just look at positives/negatives, evens/odds, or generally get an idea of what you think it will be. Science, determine the \"results\" of the passage and choose what connects to that best. If there's nothing you can tell, THEN go to your chosen letter\n\n\\- If you're spending too much time on a question, go with your gut, then next to it write down an \"R\" for \"return\" if you are debating or \"D\" for \"don't know\" if you have literally no clue. That can help you manage your time at the end (address the R ones first) if you succeed in making time for reviewing\n\n In general, the way I found to figure out the structure is to remember that the test is standardized, and that means that ultimately everything you need is going to be provided (with the exception of formulas and stuff for math) and there can only be one right answer. If you keep that in mind, it makes things a lot easier to figure stuff out. If you find yourself really reading into a question, you're probably overthinking it.   \n\nAlso, hold yourself to your time limits, and you'll notice you move faster. Giving myself 30-45 seconds per question made me take the test out faster than if I did \"20 questions in 20 minutes\" because I made sure I had momentum and didn't get myself stuck\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MATH**\n\n\\- Always use your calculator if it doesn\u2019t involve fractions. I don\u2019t think I put mine down the entire time. It saves just a tiny bit of time, and you can put that time toward reviewing at the end\n\n\\- Keep yourself moving. The first thing I did at the start was calculate how much time I could spend on each question while still having about 5-7 minutes to check my work. Hold yourself to whatever amount of seconds you choose. That way, you review and get rid of silly mistakes. (I know people like to say do x questions in 20 minutes, etc. I find that makes me go too slowly and have very little time to look over it)\n\n\\- If it\u2019s content you don\u2019t remember, just backsolve it and plug the answers into any relevant formulas you can remember\n\n\\- Triangles are annoying, but they will show up 24/7 so make sure you can do those fast\n\n\\- If there\u2019s one you can\u2019t solve in time, check for negatives/if the answer will be even or odd/fractions/etc. It\u2019s better than making a random guess \n\n\\- If you can, make sure you have a good calculator. Making sure that it\u2019s fast and graphs are easy to understand saves a ton of time\n\n\\- if you\u2019re going to review content, review old stuff. Depending on where you are in math right now, you can probably remember pre-calc pretty easily - look over Math 2/3. Even if you know the content, that\u2019s the main stuff you\u2019d want to \u201cspeed up\u201d\n\n\\- If you can solve a problem using more recent techniques, do that to save time. Pretty sure I solved a problem by taking a derivative haha.\n\n\\- Be paranoid with your parentheses if you\u2019re plugging into a calculator. I probably add more than necessary to be safe\n\n\\- On most of the function questions, you can either graph them or plug in a random value to get the right answer\n\n\\- If you don't know already, learn how to do certain applications on the calculator, like matrices can be done pretty easily which can help\n\n\\- If you're really short on time, making an estimation can help you narrow down the correct answers\n\n\\- This may not apply to everyone, but some people forget that you can also do process of elimination on math problems. If you know something can't be negative / odd / a whole number, eliminate them.\n\n\\- If your main issue is making simple mistakes, I really recommend making sure you have time to review at the end. If it's more about running out of time, keep an eye on the clock in increments smaller than 20 minutes - if you don't want to do it by question, look at 5 minute blocks instead. It can make you move faster just because you feel like you have less time, even if it ends up being the same pace. If it's content, then there are a ton of study sheets out there with formulas to make sure you know\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**READING**\n\nSome of this is going to vary by person, so take this as a general guide, and then add your personal experiences on top of it\n\n\\- I focused on one paragraph at a time when the question called for it. After enough paragraphs were looked at in depth, I would read more of the passage in its entirety when needed. Quite a few questions will only deal with one paragraph at a time \n\n\\- That previous tip does NOT mean that you shouldn\u2019t look for context in other paragraphs. Make sure you know what it\u2019s all talking about. And if a question refers to the entire text, you have to use the entire text for it: just save it for the end.\n\n\\- Also DO NOT read too fast. Read in pieces. Reading fast will have you skipping details, reading small sections in pieces will have you putting together the story. (This does work for some people, though, so I guess if it works for you it works for you)\n\n\\- PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. DO IT LIKE ALL THE TIME. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT\n\n\\- There can only be one unambiguous right answer. You want the PERFECT answer. There are no \u201ckind of correct\u201d answers: there is one right answer and three wrong answers.\n\n\\- There are five main reasons an answer is wrong: it\u2019s too specific (not mentioned in passage), too vague (in the passage but doesn\u2019t actually answer the question), it flips a relationship (says the opposite of what is said in the passage), distorts a detail (the detail is just flat out incorrect), or it\u2019s too extreme for what the author is trying to communicate\n\n\\- Focus on the topic, purpose, and theme of each passage. Most answers will connect to and support at least one of those, so it can help you see which answer could be most relevant and give you a boost\n\n\\- However: if there are actual questions about these, answer them last. You\u2019ll have a better understanding of the passage later. Piece it together and use your themes/topics/purposes as a guide if you have time to review.\n\n\\- Active reading can help! I took the test online, but on paper, I like to underline important sentences and it can make sure I\u2019m actually paying attention when the time comes\n\n\\- Start with the boring passages. It can be hard, but reading the passages will be mentally exhausting. If any of them are the least bit entertaining, save them for later, so you can maintain a level of investment\n\n\\- I like to try to think of a thesis statement for certain passages: figure out their main claim and main evidence/commentary supporting the claim. Understanding these can help you with content questions and process of elimination \n\n\\- And most importantly: every single answer MUST be in the passage somewhere, and they\u2019re often directly stated.", "score": 5, "author": "winter_yy"}, {"id": "jdkfi3z", "body": "good job! still waiting on my feb 28th test", "score": 3, "author": "SamAP06"}, {"id": "jdkx452", "body": "Need advice", "score": 1, "author": "mas1479"}, {"id": "jdm49v6", "body": "Dang, I got the same score but 35 on English :(((( (the easiest section)", "score": 1, "author": "sluggisHippo"}]},
