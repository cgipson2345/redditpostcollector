Francis recalled that the Holy See had facilitated some prisoner exchanges, working through embassies, and was open to Ukraine&#039;s request to reunite Ukrainian children with their families.

But though the supply lines running through the desert are a detail in the grand scheme of things, they may tell us more about the nature of this conflict than breathless reports from Stansted as British evacuees arrive back in the UK or briefings from Washington.\n\n>The trucks are carrying fuel from a refinery near the Libyan oasis town of al-Jawf \u2013 as well as smaller consignments of ammunition, weapons and medicine \u2013 to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which is currently battling regular army units under the control of Sudan\u2019s de facto military ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. They are being sent by Khalifa Haftar, a warlord who runs much of eastern Libya. Other supplies, including potent Kornet anti-tank missiles looted from Libyan government stocks more than a decade ago, have been transported by air, say witnesses at al-Jawf\u2019s airport.\n\n>The RSF is loyal to Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (usually referred to as Hemedti), a former camel trader who started his career in charge of a notoriously brutal militia in Sudan\u2019s south-west before graduating to industrial-scale gold smuggling and massacring pro-democracy protesters. Haftar is sending the supplies because his sponsors among states in the Middle East have asked him to and because it earns him a lot of money. A warlord in one conflict helps out another in a second, at the behest of a distant power.\n\n\u2026\n\n> The trucks across the desert tell us more. Haftar has offered assistance but has carefully balanced his need to please supporters in the United Arab Emirates, who are key partners in the gold business with Hemedti, but without annoying his other sponsors in Egypt, who are backing Burhan. Thus the need to keep the oil convoys quiet, and the precautions taken to mask the diversion of around 10,000 barrels a day of Libyan oil from a state company which is then turned into high quality fuel at the al-Sarir refinery and trucked to Hemedti\u2019s fuel-thirsty forces, according to former senior Libyan officials with access to intelligence files.\n\n>Of course, this assistance is not freely offered and the fuel is sold not given to the RSF, generating vast revenues for Haftar\u2019s extended family and businesses. The gold goes out, the fuel comes in, all paid for in massive transfers of money. This is a wartime expansion of a lucrative existing business partnership running for a decade or more. Are any laws broken? Probably. Can anyone stop the traffic? Almost certainly not. Will it bring victory to Hemedti? Unlikely. Will it prolong the conflict? Definitely.\n\n> The trucks do not move through a geopolitical vacuum. The UAE\u2019s support for Hemedti and Haftar is based on rivalry with other Middle Eastern states and financial gain. Moscow, true to its broad strategy of backing the most obvious disruptors in order to profit financially and politically from the resultant chaos, has also been supporting Hemedti and the RSF for years. Here the Russians are doing what they have done across the Sahel and elsewhere in Africa \u2013 adding a hefty dose of disinformation to the Sudanese mix for good measure. They are keen on Indian ocean naval bases \u2013 another echo of Syria, where access to the Mediterranean was a key strategic consideration. Saudi Arabia has an interest in heading off regional rivals, and gaining access to the vast agricultural resources of Sudan. Egypt is unsurprisingly keen on an authoritarian military regime in their southern neighbour so wants Burhan to win. The Chinese seek advantage against the US, votes at the UN and the kudos that comes with successful mediation. And so on, in concentric circles, out to the western Europeans, the UK and the US.

With the Customs Treaty, trade and customs agreements concluded by Switzerland with third countries automatically applied to Liechtenstein as well. The small state (which now has a population of 39,000) was thus integrated into the global economy through Swiss foreign trade policy. Liechtenstein adopted the Swiss Franc in 1924.\n\n\"The Customs Treaty opened the gateway to the world for us,\" Deputy Head of Government Sabine Monauni told the press in the run-up to the anniversary.\n\nDuring the event on Saturday, an art exhibition was opened on and around the old Rhine bridge.

Poverty increased from 5.5% to 24.2% in Ukraine in 2022, pushing 7.1 million more people into poverty with the worst impact out of sight in rural villages, according to a recent report by the World Bank. With unemployment unofficially at 36% and inflation hitting 26.6% at the end of 2022, the institution\u2019s regional country director for eastern Europe, Arup Banerji, had warned that poverty could soar.  \n\nThere's also an accompanying article on the subject for those who wish to read a bit more. It's titled [Pawn shops and bread queues: poverty grips Ukraine as war drags on](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/30/ukraine-war-poverty-irpin-pawn-shops-bread-queues).  \n\nWith Russia targeting civilian infrastructure and cutting them off from ports to export goods many people are loosing their jobs.  \n\nHere's a quote from that article:  \n>The most visible sign of the poverty crisis can be found at a protestant church in the town where priests have set up six distribution centres for free bread across the area, the busiest in Irpin itself. There, on most days, about 500 people can be found queuing for a free loaf, with tables and a tent also set up outside the centre on the day the Guardian visits, offering free secondhand shoes, clothes and children\u2019s toys.  \n\nIt's truly amazing the resilience the Ukrainians are showing against Putin.  \n\nHere's another quote from that article which shows how some non-military support is helping Ukraine in this time of crisis:  \n>The economist Olena Bilan sees a deepening crisis, but says that without a huge package of financial support from the international community, including pledges worth $43bn (\u00a334bn), the situation would be worse.\n\n>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen GDP decline by 30% in large part because Ukraine exports 80% of its goods through ports it no longer has access too. We\u2019ve had inflation of 26% \u2013 again which could have been worse \u2013 but people\u2019s salaries have also been flat and the currency has devalued against the dollar by 20%. The biggest challenge is going to be how to create new jobs.\u201d  \n\nIt's just like people have been saying since the start of this war.

I do not understand why this is being done, because the situation for our troops is threatening.

It is a normal process that NCERT follows every few years where they remove repeated chapters and add new ones to keep the books up-to-date.

If you read the NCERT textbooks, you will find that the same topic repeats four or five times in different classes and different aspects, which doesn't make any sense.\n\nNow, I know many of you argue that the current government in India is more religious, so they remove the content that does not fit Hindu culture. For those people, I just want to say please check some statistics because you can clearly see that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism are the top religions that accept Darwin's theory. We have seen the same case earlier when NCERT removed some Mudgal chapters.\n\nEdit: Even in Hinduism there was a very popular tail story Ramayan You might already know about that. Where it's clearly mentioned that our one God ( or the whole species/civilization) are half human and half Monkey which is known as Hanuman. Or not only this there was some species are which are half crow, fish, snake and many more. So if we forget about Darwin there are clearly indication that prove human evolution.\n\nPerhaps for someone, 500, 600, or 1000 years are significant in religious history, but India has a 4500+ year history (or the day when God created the earth).

They are reasonably efficient for a rail system, but because cars are not fixed on a rail I'm not sure how they would get this to work. It would also require support from car manufacturers.  \n  \n- Inductive power transmits via magnetic induction. The main issue with this is that it's incredibly inefficient over large distances, so for example to transmit power the roughly 1m from the buried induction lines to the vehicle would have an efficiency of around 10%. So to charge a vehicle with 25kWh, it would take 250kWh of energy, and 225kWh of that will be wasted.  \n  \n- Conductive is similar to caternary (indeed, caternary *is* a conductive transmission medium), but it typically refers to conductive rails or strips. These would probably be the most realistic option, but would be reasonably high maintenance, and would require manufacturer participation.  \n  \nTL:DR; some politicians wanted to pass a bill that makes them look good, but with little to no consideration for the practicality of the solution.
