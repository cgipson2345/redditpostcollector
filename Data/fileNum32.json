His two young sons were sent to Bristol Castle where they were kept in a cage until they died. Gwenllian was taken to a convent in Eastern England (Sempringham)  where she died at the age of 57 not knowing who she was. \n\nDafydd was a complex person who rekindled the war which eventually lead to his death and the destruction of the Welsh royal family and which resulted in Wales being conquered by England. His older brother Prince Llewelyn had been killed and his army destroyed in December 1282 (he had been deceived into a meeting with English representatives of Edward 1 thinking it was a parley). Llywelyn was beheaded after his death and his head taken to London and stuck on traitors gate where it remained for years where it was joined with the head of his brother.\n\nThe Welsh royal family (the House of Gwynedd) had lasted from 400 AD until 1283 ( effectively the length of the English Royal family from\n1066 until 1940). They were successors to Roman rule in Wales and continued many of the same practices including literacy and Christianity and took the title prince from the Roman meaning Principal meaning the main leader and as such in Wales Prince was a higher status than King. Often Wales is called a Principality and conflated with the English/French meaning of principality which was feudal in origin (The English and French were Germanic in origin Saxons, Normans and Franks) and were not part of the Roman world they inherited by invasion. \n\nThe English use of the term prince of Wales is a title(and an insult to many in Wales), they have no relationship to Wales itself or any authority over Wales. The last true prince of Wales was Owain Glyndwr who tantalisingly overthrew English rule for 10 years in the early fitfteenth century. Since then it reverted to English monarchs eldest sons.\n\nThe Principality of Wales (the former lands belonging to the Welsh Princes) was taken over by the crown of England and the Principality was consigned to history in 1536 when Henry VIII scraped it. Wales is no longer a principality.\n\nThere was however a member of the Welsh royal family who survived. His name was Rhodri, a younger brother. He forsook the claim to become Prince of Wales and survived along with his family. Their heirs still live in Wales and the heir apparent to the Welsh royal family is a retired lawyer. \n\nMeanwhile the charade (and the insult) of the English Royal family  remains with the latest having the title conferred on him by a whim by his spoilt father who is going to get a magic hat this Saturday", "score": 1500, "author": "rachelm791"}, {"id": "jitiae7", "body": "The execution of the prince is also one of the first recorded instances of hanging, drawing and quartering in Great Britain.

On Earth, elevation correlates with many natural phenomena such as air pressure, climate, and vegetation. However, elevation suffers from a major problem: it doesn't work on other planets that don't have a sea level to base zero-elevation off of. Elevation also doesn't describe much about how much a mountain rises above its surroundings. A tiny hill on the Tibetan Plateau can have a higher elevation than a much larger mountain that rises from close to sea level.\n\nChimborazo wins in terms of [geocentric distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimborazo), or distance from the center of Earth. However, to human beings who dwell on Earth's surface, this metric is largely irrelevant. It isn't particularly useful to say that Chimborazo is 6,384.4 km tall as measured from the center of Earth, if we could only see a few kilometers of it.\n\nAnother metric you may have heard of is [prominence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence), which determines whether a mountain rises independently enough to be considered the summit of a mountain, rather than a subpeak or a non-summit point.\n\nYet another metric is [dominance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/wfmrxw/a_new_way_to_measure_the_height_of_a_mountain/), a measure of how much a mountain rises above its large-scale surroundings, that unlike elevation, can be used on any planet. The mountain that measures the highest dominance on Earth is the volcano [Mauna Kea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea), which is said to have the greatest base-to-peak rise on the planet.\n\nFinally, [jut](https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/12bltmj/mountains_in_the_contiguous_us_by_rise_above/) is an indicator that measures how sharply or impressively a mountain rises above its immediate surroundings, factoring in both height and steepness. The highest jut goes to [Annapurna Fang](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mountaineering/comments/xeba6s/unclimbed_southwest_face_of_annapurna_fang_the/), the apex of the biggest mountain face in the world.\n\nLong story short, there isn't a \"right\" way to measure a mountain per se, but some are more useful than others depending on the situation.", "score": 4, "author": "Gigitoe", "page_title": "Elevation), - Wikipedia"}]},

However, their mode of transport was quite different from today: Think four legs instead of four wheels. For Medieval swordsmen on horseback, it made sense to keep to the left to have their right arms closer to their opponents. (Presumably, the 10 to 15 percent of left-handed knights just had to make it work.) Mounting and dismounting were also easier from the left side of the horse, and safer done by the side of the road than in the center.\n\nThings changed in the late 1700s when large wagons pulled by several pairs of horses were used to transport farm products in France and the United States. In the absence of a driver\u2019s seat inside the wagon, the driver sat on the rear left horse, with his right arm free to use his whip to keep the horses moving. Since he was sitting on the left, he wanted other wagons to pass on his left, so he kept to the right side of the road.\n\n\nThe British Government refused to give up their left-hand driving ways, and in 1773 introduced the General Highways Act, which encouraged driving on the left. This was later made law thanks to The Highway Act of 1835. Meanwhile post-revolution France, under their left-handed ruler Napoleon, embraced a permanent move to the right side of the road. Amidst all this driving confusion, the British and the French were yielding their power across the globe, and as part of their rapid colonization, they insisted that the countries they occupied drive on the same side of the road. This explains why former British colonies such as Australia, New Zealand, and India drive on the left, while former French colonies like Algeria, Ivory Coast, and Senegal drive on the right.\n\nWhen Henry Ford unveiled his Model T in 1908, the driver\u2019s seat was on the left, meaning that cars would have to drive on the right-hand side of the road to allow front and back passengers to exit the car onto the curb. According to\u00a0National Geographic, this influenced a change in many countries: Canada, Italy, and Spain changed to right-side driving in the 1920s and most of Eastern Europe followed suit in the 1930s. As recently as 1967 (and thanks to around $120 million from their government\u2019s pocket) Swedish drivers began driving on the right. However British drivers remain on the left, and this is highly unlikely to change.\"", "score": 28, "author": "Master_Shake23"}]},

Glial abnormalities do not always mean that you will cause autism, which also explains why the parent in many cases doesn\u2019t have autism or hyper mobility but the offspring might have one or both, the parent will carry the gene and when passed on it might impact the body, mind or both.\n\n[http://www.neuroplastix.com/styled-2/page139/styled-42/brainsconnectivetissue.html#:\\~:text=The%20glial%20cells%20are%20part,exists%20throughout%20the%20entire%20body](http://www.neuroplastix.com/styled-2/page139/styled-42/brainsconnectivetissue.html#:~:text=The%20glial%20cells%20are%20part,exists%20throughout%20the%20entire%20body).\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10869/#:\\~:text=There%20are%20three%20types%20of,the%20prefix%20\u201castro\u201d](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10869/#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20types%20of,the%20prefix%20\u201castro\u201d)).\n\n**I think that the important takeaway if you read anything here is that 1:5 mothers who have joint hypermobility have a child with autism.

You carry one or more pathogenic mutations/variants that impact a gene's normal expression or function.

All the odds ratio is teling us is that if you have joint hypermobility, you are 3.1 x as likely as the general population to also have ASD. That's it.

What people now call \u201cauto-tune\u201d is really just heavy pitch manipulation and can be achieved with many other pitch manipulators besides Auto-Tune. \n\nDespite the stigma that the device (it was a hardware unit before it became a software plug-in) is for people who can\u2019t sing, it\u2019s actually quite the opposite - it was invented for those who CAN sing.\n\nModern recorded music - regardless of the talent level of the musicians and writers - is intended to sound perfect and flawless.  To accomplish this illusion of perfection, it often requires many different takes of a performance to be pieced together.  One of the things that would be considered a \u201cbad\u201d take for a vocalist (there are other things, of course) is the singer being sharp or flat.  That is, singing either slightly above or slightly below the intended note or notes.  Sometimes, studio sessions become very complex and time consuming which increases the risk of the vocalists vocal chords giving out.  To reduce the amount of potential vocal takes, pitch correction was invented.\n\nThe idea was that the device would correct those VERY slight misses on short words or phrases and put them closer to the intended note.  The thing with the human voice is that it\u2019s not a flat linear pitch.  Meaning that the pitch naturally fluctuates above and below the \u201ccenter\u201d.  The Antares Auto-Tune processor had settings which you could use to increase the strength of the correction.  At its strongest setting, it would force the pitch to a straight, flat, note.  That is why, when you use the strongest setting on a human voice, it sounds robotic - because a human voice does not naturally work that way.\n\nThe device was intended to be used with very light setting so that it\u2019s effect wasn\u2019t noticeable at all.  The vocalist was still expected to deliver a stellar performance but without having to throw away a great take that was VERY SLIGHTLY out of tune.  Or a take in which one word or syllable was slightly off.\n\nI regret to inform you that many of your favorite songs used some form of pitch manipulation (not necessarily Antares Auto-Tune).  Even some of the greatest vocalists in the world.  You don\u2019t know it because it was used the way it was intended. \n\nThanks to Cher (or more accurately, her producers and engineers) it became fashionable to use it \u201cincorrectly\u201d.  It\u2019s now used as a special effect - again - even with some of the world\u2019s greatest vocalists.\n\nFun Fact - in the Antares Auto-Tune (the hardware version) manual, it teaches you how to use the strongest settings and refers to it as \u201cThe Cher Effect\u201d.", "score": 2, "author": "47radAR"}, {"id": "ji6dh4j", "body": "So many music producers coming out of the woodwork.", "score": 4, "author": "concretecat"}, {"id": "ji5r8o2", "body": "And used heavily by U.S. forces to drive Noriega out of Panama.", "score": 3, "author": "Due_Signature_5497"}, {"id": "ji6mxhg", "body": "And it still slaps", "score": 1, "author": "ViennettaLurker"}, {"id": "ji78p9w", "body": "And I've hated this roboticized vocal sound ever since.", "score": 3, "author": "DocPeacock"}, {"id": "ji6bnux", "body": "It was fucking awful.

Thus, if attending ants prefer the morph excreting a high-quality honeydew, such trade-offs and resulting competitive interactions are expected between the color morphs in M. yomogicola. The morph excreting high-quality honeydew is known to have a lower reproductive rate than the other morphs^[9,10]. This fact implies that if the attending ants prefer one morph, this morph is expected to excrete high-quality honeydew.

It has effectively zero atmosphere so there isn't really a \"temperature on the moon\" in an atmospheric sense like we think of on earth. These are all surface temps. Like the soil surface, the space suit surface, moon buggy surface, etc. \n\n2. Heat is removed from an object in 3 ways, conduction, convection, and radiation. With conduction being the most efficient form of heat transfer and radiation being the least. Well, on the surface of the moon, you aren't touching anything, except the bottom of your feet, but that doesn't really help the rest of your space suit. Since there isn't an atmosphere, you can't use convection to shed heat into, and so all that's left is the heat shed via radiation, more specifically, infrared emissions. \n\nNow, to be able to reject heat you need your \"sight\" in any particular direction to have a lower amount of heat coming from it than you're emitting. So picture a metallic sphere floating about 3ft (1m) off the surface of the moon. What do you see when you look at it? Well, the bottom half is reflecting up a mirror of the moon's surface, most of the top half is showing empty space, one spot is showing the sun, and one spot is showing the earth. All of the area where you see the moon, sun, and earth, are areas where the sphere cannot reject heat from. (Very simplified explanation here) It tries, but ultimately it's receiving more than it can reject. So less than half of the sphere can reject heat using the least efficient method of rejecting heat, while surrounded by the sun, the moon, and the earth all rejecting heat into the sphere.

It's a petting zoo type thing where people bring kids. \n\nThe chickens were eerily calm that day and it wasn't until I cleaned their pen that I realized why. Every so often, a mouse would run across their pen, take a bit of food, and run out. They watched the little thing go back and forth, they were hypnotized by it.\n\nA couple of chickens took a step forward whenever the mouse disappeared from sight. Mouse goes to the food, chicken takes a step. Mouse goes back away, chicken takes a step. By the 8th or 9th trip, three chickens were right at the path that the mouse was following back and forth. Then they stilled. \n\nI don't know what goes on in a chickens mind, but I remember Jurassic Park and XKCD. Raptors were planners, schemers, they were smart. They had to be, they were also small. Small as a turkey. They had to be smart and hunt in packs to survive. \n\nMouse goes to the bowl, chicken takes a step and squats behind him. Mouse heads back, chicken is in the way, the mouse stops. That was the mistake of his life. There was a moment of clarity within the little mouse brain, that I imagine was interrupted by him getting swarmed by three chickens. The first one grabbed him by the back. It slammed him into the ground over and over. \n\nBY the fourth or fifth slam, the mouse was freed. Only for a second, hen two got his tail. Oh boy, did she get him by the tail. She swung him around like a ball at the end of a string. On one arc, hen 3 grabbed his front paw. They pulled the poor mouse, I saw that little beady eye come to the realization that this was it. \n\nYou know how chickens can keep their head in place while you move their body? They can also keep their body in place while you move their head. So two chicken heads moving opposite directions, one up and one down, well, that leads to a pretty rough bit of spontaneous chiropractics for little Fievel. Never in my life did I think I would hear a spine break in person, but I did.\n\nSome people say that it could be so quiet that you can hear a mouse fart. I realized that even when it's loud with children running and screaming, you can still hear a mouse's spine snap. However, the mouse was still alive. The back legs and tail went limp but the front legs were still whirring away. Then they dropped him and just watched him drag himself for a couple of feet. \n\nThis is around the time that all hell broke loose. The pen had 12 chickens. 3 were actively and non consensually dissecting this mouse while the other 9 watched, like a crowd watching a gladiator serve a death sentence. Empowered by the crippled little rodent, a chorus of 12 chickens screamed for blood. It slowly became a mosh pit of feather, these little hens just went ape on the poor thing. Kicks, bites, pecks, stomps, I lost sight of the mouse in flying feathers and fur. When the chickens dispersed, after what felt like an eternity, there was just a streak of blood left where a mouse once sat.\n\nThe idea that dinosaurs had feathers wasn't as popular back then.

So the rumor is that the oedema being caused by the equagesic was just a cover story for the truth.\n\nApparently he thought that sweating from your armpits enough to show through your shirt (aka pitting out) was undignified and not how a man should appear. The problem was he was obviously sweating buckets from working so hard. So he got a treatment in his armpits to prevent them from sweating, essentially Botox in your armpit sweat glands.\n\nSo it appeared to work fine, until Bruce started sparring or practicing his moves one day. He got sweaty, but not from his pits and eventually he collapsed from what people assumed was heat exhaustion. I believe the theory is that the armpit sweat glands were basically putting waste back into the body since they couldn't sweat it out normally.

(Having a child with a deformity or mental illness could be interpreted as a punishment from god for some unknown sin.)\n\nHypergraphia can be a result of mania or schizophrenia or any number of conditions. While the Voynich isn't necessarily hypergraphia, we have seen other examples of mysterious, codified and or prodigious works over the centuries. Look at Henry Darger, whose work can be interpreted as beautiful even while showing evidence of (but never proving) other more concerning behaviors or disorders. \n\nThe world has seen many of these objects over the millennia. But because of the transient nature of matter, few survive. An incredible and irascible object, created by someone gifted, but with problems. It would be nice if secret knowledge existed.

I dated a girl for a short while who's mother was also abusive and also had a personality disorder (Overt Narcissistic Personality disorder, Diagnosed) and her father would walk away whenever their mother went on a tirade and act like it wasn't his business because he was also afraid of the wife. My ex and her brother both ended up with NPD as well, him as an overt narcissist and her as a covert one. if their dad had stepped in...maybe they'd have stood a chance at normal healthy lives but they're irreparably fucked now. In public she was a saint. She made sure people saw her giving, she acted very caring and charismatic, but not overtly. Her friends saw her as some sort of beautiful creature but me and all her exes experienced something else entirely. She was absolutely unbearably mean in private, cold, rude, dead on the inside. Everything centered around what she wanted and she had zero problem saying as much and saying that my problems didn't matter because her \"life is so much harder and I hate it!\". She ripped open wounds from my childhood that I had thought I had processed already (I hadn't) and sent me spiraling. Drugs, alcohol, stupid mistakes, living just to escape. The relationship only lasted 4-5 months but because I was primed for the abuse already, the way I handled it just gave her way too much control. It took me a full 2 years and regular therapy before I can finally say I've crawled out from underneath the shadow of her AND my father and I finally feel like I can be confident in myself.

This doesn't mean teaching everyone Mandarin and the loss of language like what happen in South East Asia with the destruction of the Krai Dai Language groups but an integration of local regions. An example would be Korean and Japanese with are both derivative languages of Han or Mandarin which is originates from the North Eastern Region of Asia. Through both languages has problems such as implicit sexism to a hierarchical structure built into the languages. Similar problems exist in African Languages unironically. Fundamentally we need to change the vast majority of languages. Not as vaguely as entirely removing the mentioning of gender.

Pyres were pagan and cremation was for plague victims, so there was social stigma against it. This changed when the very elderly Welsh druid, physician, and Chartist, Dr William Price, fathered a child with his housekeeper at the age of 83 and her 24.\n\nAt the age of five months, the child tragically died and Price was distraught. He refused to \"pollute the earth\" with a corpse, and instead built a pyre atop a hill to respectfully dispose of the body in the ways of his ancestors.\n\nAn angry mob, inflamed by rumours the infant had been murdered, descended on the event and attacked Price. He was saved by the police, the baby's body recovered and autopsied. The coroner recorded a verdict of natural death.\n\nPolice arrested Price for illegal disposal of a body, and Price defended himself. A storied man of some formidable intellect and education, he conceded that he accepted the prosecutions case: The law did not say cremation was legal.\n\nHowever, he argued he had no case to answer! The law also did not say cremation was illegal. Judge Justice Stephen agreed and this decision opened the door to the establishment of formal crematoriums... \n\nHowever, later amendments to the Cremation Act 1902 in 1930 sought to forbid open air cremations, which had been done in Brighton for fallen Sikh and Hindu soldiers of the Great War. The rising tide of nationalism had neither love nor respect for the Sikhs and Hindus who gave their life for Britain and open air cremation was forbidden, under the false aspices of air quality, in a nation burning sulphurous coal for everything.\n\nIn July 2006, Davender Ghai, devout Hindu and British citizen performed the first open air funeral pyre cremation since 1934. He informed police, who allowed it to take place, then disgracefully cited the the 1930 act.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service declined to prosecute, but Ghai was incensed. He launched a judicial review. The 1930 act could be read in such a way that no funeral custom could be forbidden if it were properly authorised and did not cause public alarm, offence or nuisance. Ghai claimed all of this was met, so his act was legal. Further, if the 1930 Act sought to forbid it, it was a violation of the Human Rights Act 1998, Articles 8 and 9.\n\nThe High Court gave him permission to challenge the law in 2007. The local council and the central Government opposed him. In February 2010, the Court of Appeal ruled that open air pyres were not forbidden by the 1930 Act at all, so long as they took place \"within a structure of some sort\".

In this situation, a specific seat is designated as crew rest and would have a privacy curtain that separates it from the rest of the cabin. This seat would be sold as normal on a flight where crew rest is not required; however, the passenger would not be allowed to utilize the curtain.\n\nA class 3 rest area is usually just a row of coach seats with more recline and foot rests, typically the last row or two. Most of these that I have seen also have a privacy curtain that can be put around the seats.There is usually a small placard to indicate that it is a crew rest seat, and what type of crew rest it is.\n\nI believe in all instances the crew are entitled to sit by themselves and not directly next to anyone, so if the first class seats are in a 2-2 configuration, they would have to block off both seats on one side for one crew member.All of this can play a big part when deciding what planes to send where.\n\nFor a short time I was tasked with finding planes with crew rests out of service and blocking off first class seats for the crew to use instead. Some crew like the first class lie flat seat better than the bunk (a little more room, TV) and would write up erroneous maintenance items for the bunk so that they would get the first class seat.\n\nMost of this knowledge came from my experience at one of the big three.

Ahmjed Ali, then aged 37, an ethnic Indian who worked as a refueler for Air Terminal Services, entered the flight deck and told to the captain that he was carrying dynamite and would blow up the aircraft if his demands were not met.\n\nUsing the plane's radio, he demanded the release of the deposed Fijian prime minister, Dr. Timoci Bavadra, and his 27 ministers who were being held under house arrest by rebel leader Lt. Col. Sitiveni Rabuka in the 1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat. Ali also demanded to be flown to Libya.[2]\n\nAll 105 passengers and 21 of the 24 crew disembarked. Captain Graham Gleeson, flight engineer Graeme Walsh, and first officer Michael McLeay[3] remained with Ali in the cockpit. For six hours, Ali talked with relatives in the Nadi tower and Air New Zealand negotiators in Auckland.[4] Meanwhile, the New Zealand Special Air Service were placed on a state of \"preparedness.\"[1]\n\nAt around 1 p.m., while Ali was distracted with the radio, flight engineer Walsh hit him with a bottle of whiskey. The crew members were able to overpower Ali and handed him over to local police. He received a suspended sentence for taking explosives onto an aircraft.[4]\n\nAftermath\nEdit\nFollowing the incident, New Zealand's Prime Minister, David Lange, said that he was \"grateful\" the incident was over.

In 2014, Ali confirmed to the Dominion Post that he has been granted permanent residency in New Zealand since 2009.

The answer will surprise you. \n\nTLDR at the bottom, it\u2019s quite a lengthy explanation.\n\nLet\u2019s start here on earth:\n\nTo calculate the average golfer's swing and ball velocity here on Earth, we need to make some assumptions. Let's assume that the golf ball weighs 45 grams, and that the average golfer's clubhead speed is around 90 miles per hour (40.2 meters per second) at impact. Using these assumptions, we can calculate the ball's velocity as it leaves the clubface using the formula:\n\nBall Velocity = Clubhead Speed x Efficiency Factor\n\nThe efficiency factor represents the ratio of the clubhead speed to the ball speed, taking into account energy losses due to factors such as friction and deformation. The efficiency factor is typically around 0.8 for a driver, which means that 80% of the clubhead speed is transferred to the ball.\n\nUsing this efficiency factor, the ball velocity on Earth can be calculated as follows:\n\nBall Velocity = 40.2 m/s x 0.8 = 32.16 m/s\n\nNow, let's consider how the moon's gravity affects the ball's velocity. The moon's gravitational acceleration is about 1.6 meters per second squared, which is only about one-sixth of Earth's gravitational acceleration. Therefore, the ball's velocity on the moon will be much lower than it would be on Earth, as the weaker gravity will not allow the ball to travel as far.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that there is no air resistance on the moon, which means that the ball will not lose speed due to air resistance as it would on Earth. Assuming the same golfer's swing as on Earth, the ball's velocity on the moon can be calculated as follows:\n\nBall Velocity on Moon = Ball Velocity on Earth x \u221a(moon's gravity / Earth's gravity)\n\nBall Velocity on Moon = 32.16 m/s x \u221a(1.6 / 9.81) = 18.01 m/s\n\nTherefore, the ball's velocity on the moon when hit with the same golfer's swing will be approximately 18.01 meters per second. This is significantly lower than the ball's velocity on Earth due to the weaker gravitational acceleration on the moon, which limits the distance the ball can travel.\n\nTLDR: Ball not go as far as think.", "score": -3, "author": "BuzBuzzB"}, {"id": "jh85lck", "body": "Afterwards, Alan went fishing and caught one THIS BIG!", "score": -1, "author": "LakeEarth"}, {"id": "jh8qyt2", "body": "That's awesome, yet the first thing Man did on the moon was litter?", "score": -6, "author": "lysinemagic"}, {"id": "jh86r6k", "body": "I did the same the other day\u2026and wrote par", "score": 0, "author": "manhatim"}, {"id": "jh8oekh", "body": "He once also caught a fish tthhhiiiissss bigggggg", "score": 0, "author": "CaptnSpazmo"}, {"id": "jh99y88", "body": "Is it still going? \ud83d\ude05", "score": 0, "author": "HDespoina"}, {"id": "jh9aafq", "body": "KonK!", "score": 0, "author": "tarkofkntuesday"}, {"id": "jh9acdj", "body": "No he didn't.\n\nThe moon is cheese.", "score": 0, "author": "realrussell"}, {"id": "jh9bkzk", "body": "Golfers gotta hit a ball every continent.

We may not have had nearly as much medical knowledge in the past, but those who lived then certainly knew enough to be able to tell death by prolonged exposure to the elements apart from death by human violence. Moreover, had the farmer been responsible for killing them, he most certainly would have left a trail or evidence that the search party would have found. Grown people don't go through the forest without leaving a trace.\n\nThe possibility that the two kids, aged five and seven, followed their father into the woods, got lost, and eventually succumbed to the cold seems far more likely than a farmer managing to kill two kids, disguise their deaths as deaths by exposure, and exit the forest without leaving any trace. The only thing that could possibly point to the farmer being responsible is his dream, but it is certainly not unheard of for people to dream about things that happened and piece it all together. Also, the likelihood he would have bothered to help people find the kids if he was responsible for killing them is exceedingly low.\n\nJust because prophetic dreams ain't real, doesn't mean that the farmer went and killed two kids for the fun of it.

Beyond just being the first to throw the devil horns, they're also known for having a track off their debut with the title \"Black Sabbath\", and their bassist is even named \"Ozz Osbourne\"\u2014 and this was the case in 1969, a full year before Black Sabbath themselves broke through.\n\n\nI think the real reason why Coven never quite broke through is because for all their authentic occultism and Satanism, they did indeed sound like \"Satanic Scooby-Doo tunes\" with a lead singer taking cues from Janis Joplin, and this was happening in 1969, right as proto-metal was starting to take off and take over from psychedelia. The music itself isn't that heavy. It's like, if you cross Coven with Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin, you get Black Sabbath. If they had just amped up their guitars, they might have hit it bigger. If they had more secular lyrics, maybe they could have courted more mainstream/counterculture listeners, but the ones who would've been into their heavy occult-rock vibes would probably have been uninterested in how lightweight the music itself was.

The Guinea worm's lifecycle goes like this;  The eggs are ingested from an infected water source.  The eggs hatch, and borrow through your flesh until they reach your lower leg.  At this point, they begin to eat a hole through your skin, while also excreting an irritant that makes your skin feel like it's burning.  Most people's initial reaction is to submerse the leg in cool water and a lot of the time, that cool water is also a drinking source for other people.  Once you do this it finishes burrowing out of your leg and lays eggs in the water for the next person to drink.\n\nIn order to remove the worm, it needs to be pulled out very slowly so as not to break it off and cause an infection as it rots.  The only non-surgical way to do this is to start wrapping it around a stick and twist it out very slowly over the course of days or weeks.  This is widely considered to be one of the first official \"medical procedures\"  in human history and that is why the symbol for medicine is a snake (worm) wrapped around a stick.", "score": 31, "author": "lol_camis"}, {"id": "eieglug", "body": "My boy Donny Hopkins.
